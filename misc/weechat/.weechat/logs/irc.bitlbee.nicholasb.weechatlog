2016-02-26 11:31:34	NicholasB	and let the juice soak in for a minute or two
2016-02-26 11:31:39	NicholasB	before you start

2016-02-26 11:32:48	fsociety	let alone to plug in the charger
2016-02-26 11:32:54	NicholasB	the base of the battery twists
2016-02-26 11:33:15	NicholasB	the chargec screw to the top
2016-02-26 11:33:51	NicholasB	but it has some charge I think

2016-02-26 11:40:29	fsociety	yeah i put in the 12
2016-02-26 11:40:34	fsociety	explains my nicotine buzz
2016-02-26 11:40:42	fsociety	i usually only smoke 8s
2016-02-26 11:40:45	NicholasB	after a while (like 5 dayo to a week)
2016-02-26 11:40:53	NicholasB	replace the coil
2016-02-26 11:41:03	fsociety	wears out quickly hey
2016-02-26 11:41:13	NicholasB	12mg is close to an 8 in a cigarrete as far as absorbion goes
2016-02-26 11:41:36	NicholasB	the coils? yeah but ther are cheap
2016-02-26 11:41:44	NicholasB	5ish bucks for a packet
2016-02-26 12:00:10	fsociety	ahh thats pretty cheap
2016-02-26 12:00:31	fsociety	had to put it up pretty high to begin with to deal with going from cigarettes to these though
2016-02-26 12:00:49	fsociety	i'd imagine i could drop it down after a week or so.. when those cigarettes urges slowly disappear
2016-02-26 12:06:14	NicholasB	Do what Dan did. Smoke vape in the day. Cigs at noght
2016-02-26 12:06:28	NicholasB	And after a week or two you'll be off the cigs
