2016-04-22 10:31:16	fsociety	You online Scott?
2016-04-22 10:31:16		[10:31]
2016-04-22 10:31:19	fsociety	How are you ?
2016-04-22 10:33:06	ScottBullock	Good mate, how are you?
2016-04-22 10:33:40	fsociety	yeah not too bad.. hows the job going
2016-04-22 10:33:58	ScottBullock	Job is good, flat out, but good
2016-04-22 10:34:19	fsociety	excellent sir - i finally changed jobs
2016-04-22 10:34:34	ScottBullock	Just hired a few new people and the tech is being well behaved!
2016-04-22 10:34:46	ScottBullock	What/where are you now?
2016-04-22 10:35:14	fsociety	i look after a new start-up called virtua .  we make 3d projects of up and coming constructions - like theme parks, etc.  we use unreal4 - i do a lot of AI stuff and I look after the server backend.  Because the other guys are scared of that stuff. haha
2016-04-22 10:35:49	ScottBullock	That's awesome, in fact, it..  Unreal!
2016-04-22 10:36:00	ScottBullock	Sorry, I had to be punny
2016-04-22 10:36:02	fsociety	hahahaha
2016-04-22 10:36:12	fsociety	well it puts my 32gb of ram to good use thats for sure
2016-04-22 10:36:30	fsociety	though unlike the other guys i usually sit the IDE in Linux where the other guys - Windows
2016-04-22 10:36:54	fsociety	hows fb going.. haha
2016-04-22 10:37:16	ScottBullock	I need that much RAM..  Out OVA want's 16GB min, and I need 32 to create a virtual cluster
2016-04-22 10:37:24	fsociety	pfft. get 64
2016-04-22 10:37:25	fsociety	lol
2016-04-22 10:37:36	ScottBullock	That's not even counting the other VM's i need for my lan!
2016-04-22 10:37:56	fsociety	nice to hear that your new employees are being well behaved
2016-04-22 10:38:01	fsociety	are they windows techs or unix techs?
2016-04-22 10:38:04	ScottBullock	hah, yes, 64 with a bunch of SSD's..  Super fast vm's
2016-04-22 10:38:18	fsociety	get a cluster of pci ssd cards
2016-04-22 10:38:23	fsociety	raid the shit of them .. woooosh
2016-04-22 10:39:05	ScottBullock	We're mostly on the darkside, SE's and sales.  The tech part of the SE's is a mix of many things, big focus on security nd network
2016-04-22 10:39:37	ScottBullock	The actual tech is a freebsd base with our big binary blob on top
2016-04-22 10:39:54	fsociety	so im guessing openbsd
2016-04-22 10:40:03	ScottBullock	Wr write all our own engines, network stack, clustering
2016-04-22 10:40:09	fsociety	ahh nice
2016-04-22 10:40:17	fsociety	so using libressl instead of openssl?
2016-04-22 10:40:49	ScottBullock	It's pretty neat.  I don't know on SSL, I know it's not openssl as we didn't get hit by heartbleed.
2016-04-22 10:40:54	fsociety	one thing i love about bsd is no fucking systemd
2016-04-22 10:41:06	fsociety	i removed systemd from my arch instead and used openrc (gentoo init system)
2016-04-22 10:41:17	fsociety	simple init system, something bsd kept with .. and linux should have done
2016-04-22 10:41:18	ScottBullock	I'm led to believe we wrote our own SSL stack, but I'm well removed form the engineers doing the actual coding
2016-04-22 10:41:26	fsociety	ahhhh
2016-04-22 10:41:43	fsociety	you are more sales im imaginging
2016-04-22 10:42:40	ScottBullock	I do get to load features and bug's into JIRA!  But yes, more on the sales/solution/arch side
2016-04-22 10:43:18	fsociety	haha jira
2016-04-22 10:43:30	fsociety	oh jira.. been using that thing since 3.11
2016-04-22 10:43:37	ScottBullock	I got burnt out coding when I worked in a startup in '03..   Was a super cool linux based firewall and wifi gateway.
2016-04-22 10:44:53	ScottBullock	It was this time I relased I had no natural inclination for UX and awesomes for backend, that lead to infra jobs, network jobs and now this!  And JIRA rocks.  We used to use bugzilla.  Argh!
2016-04-22 10:45:19	fsociety	jira does rock, mainly because the api makes it so extendable
2016-04-22 10:45:30	fsociety	only thing i don't like about it.. java.. shudder
2016-04-22 10:45:38	fsociety	i'd prefer python over java
2016-04-22 10:45:51	ScottBullock	At least it's not pushing applets!
2016-04-22 10:46:53	fsociety	indeed. but best of all its good ol AU product :)
2016-04-22 10:46:53		[10:46]
2016-04-22 10:47:20	fsociety	i must say my true love is backend server stuff. the unreal4 ai stuff is fun.. but its meh compared to creating a backend for this startup :)
2016-04-22 10:48:20	ScottBullock	I know, so good.  Imagine we we actually fostered proper dev communities here.  They battled a lot to stay here, it must have been tempting to sell out or fly the coup
2016-04-22 10:49:22	fsociety	thats good.. if you have good internal dev communities.. most programmers would stay
2016-04-22 10:49:35	ScottBullock	true this
2016-04-22 10:51:53	fsociety	i had many drunken conversations with jono bacon at linuxconf
2016-04-22 10:51:54	ScottBullock	You still out Heathcote way?
2016-04-22 10:52:01	fsociety	naaa. fairfield
2016-04-22 10:52:10	ScottBullock	ah, yeh

2016-04-22 10:53:30	fsociety	and now my media grabbing software has started to replace a lot of content with x265 10bit 4k stuff. haha
2016-04-22 10:53:35	fsociety	need to purchase a 4k t

2016-04-22 11:10:00		[11:04]
2016-04-22 11:23:23	ScottBullock	We had some other thinks to bank on for this..  Especially considering we were buying, I coudn't use internent as a means of vetoing the whole house, which is an awesome house.
2016-04-22 11:28:47	fsociety	i can.. haha
2016-04-22 11:28:47		[11:28]

2016-04-22 11:42:33	ScottBullock	Ha!
