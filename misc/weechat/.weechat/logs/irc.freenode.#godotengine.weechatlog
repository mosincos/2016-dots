2016-03-11 07:38:07	falsaber1	hell, it's still hard to find android 4 stuff here
2016-03-11 07:40:20	ArcFutahito	It was really hard to find a good budget phone with 5.0 (won't even spend any good money on anything that's not a Nexus which I don't really need yet). Finding 6.0 in physical stores with a price tag that wouldn't be insane at the time I was buying it (winter 2015) was completely impossible

2016-03-11 07:45:43	henkz	ArcFutahito, it's always like this, they announce new version before or at IO, then release it later that year.. "winter 2015" android 6 had been out like 2 months or something, no wonder you couldn't find a cheap one
2016-03-11 07:46:46	ArcFutahito	well, it's spring 2016 and there's android 7 developer preview already, with plans to launch it Q3 2016 if I recall correctly

2016-03-11 07:47:04	henkz	yea, thats how it works
2016-03-11 07:47:47	henkz	a year agi there where almost no devices with 5, now it's the one with largest installbase
2016-03-11 07:48:26	ArcFutahito	Well, the thing is that most device manufacturers don't really do such major updates. Heck, my phone is still on 5.2 and I don't think that there will be any plans about doing 6
2016-03-11 07:49:15	ArcFutahito	Lower version life means manufacturers will stop giving a damn earlier
2016-03-11 07:49:26	ArcFutahito	Which, in turn, means less security updates
2016-03-11 07:49:54	ArcFutahito	To be honest, updates is the only thing I'm choosing Nexus as my next device
2016-03-11 07:50:17	henkz	maybe, my nexus 10 never got 6, but it gets security updates monthly.. bu ye thats a nexus
2016-03-11 07:51:08	ArcFutahito	Well, I haven't got an update in god knows how long (actually, somewhere in the winter my phone got 5.2 and that's it).
2016-03-11 07:51:51	ArcFutahito	so, uh, that's why fast releases of android are not as good as they seem 101 for ya
2016-03-11 07:52:57	ArcFutahito	Also, major changes tend to break things like Xposed framework, which is a must if you want to have at least some control over your private information
2016-03-11 07:53:39	ArcFutahito	And, yes, android 6 permission management system is shit
2016-03-11 07:54:13	henkz	well yea, Im not saying it's any good :D in fact I dont like the android apis at all

2016-03-11 07:55:57	ArcFutahito	Says something about implementation of the feature
2016-03-11 07:56:15	manokara|lap	yeah. kitkat and the external sd stuff.
2016-03-11 07:57:51	ArcFutahito	It's just so stupid after how on IO they said that they would off load most of the OS on Google Store so every system will get all the updates despite manufacturers not caring and they still continue with this crap
2016-03-11 07:59:13	manokara|lap	someone should start a smartphone company focused on freedom for the users...

2016-03-11 08:01:55	manokara|lap	i've heard somewhere that ubuntu phone has an android/java layer. is that true?
2016-03-11 08:02:05	ArcFutahito	not anymore
2016-03-11 08:02:14	ArcFutahito	Oh wait
2016-03-11 08:02:17	ArcFutahito	Yeah
2016-03-11 08:02:20	ArcFutahito	It actually is
2016-03-11 08:02:30	manokara|lap	meh
2016-03-11 08:02:37	ArcFutahito	I though you were asking if ubuntu runs on top of android
2016-03-11 08:02:49	ArcFutahito	And it did for quite some time
2016-03-11 08:03:36	manokara|lap	hmm, i see
2016-03-11 08:05:22	ArcFutahito	the hilarious thing, there's no way to see ubuntu "store" on your PC. unofficial store is a pretty nice thing to show how active the community is (spoiler alert: not very active) https://uappexplorer.com/apps

2016-03-11 08:09:49	DerRidda	Ubuntu Touch doesn't run on Java/Android.
2016-03-11 08:10:20	manokara|lap	great!
2016-03-11 08:10:25	ArcFutahito	I'll do the multiboot on my hypothetical nexus and install ubuntu touch just for shits and giggles. Don't see it as a good phone os option right now. Maybe only as a convergence device
2016-03-11 08:10:54	Raven67854	Ubuntu doesn't have java
2016-03-11 08:10:54	ArcFutahito	DerRidda, it did. Not anymore. But I think ubuntu touch has compatibility layer for android apps?
2016-03-11 08:10:56	Raven67854	or an android layer
2016-03-11 08:11:05	Raven67854	At all
2016-03-11 08:11:08	Raven67854	It never has
2016-03-11 08:11:18	Raven67854	It was a proposed suggestion once but that's about it
2016-03-11 08:11:43	DerRidda	At no time did Ubuntu touch use an Android layer, what you are thinking of is an explicitly different project called Ubuntu for Android which never went anywhere.
2016-03-11 08:11:59	manokara|lap	oh. so the apps are 100% ELF? yay
2016-03-11 08:12:10	ArcFutahito	Ok, guys, ok, relax
2016-03-11 08:12:18	DerRidda	Yes, natively compiled armhf.
2016-03-11 08:13:06	DerRidda	The official SDK basically only offers C/C++ and Go, plus some built in support for JavaScript/HTML5 apps.
2016-03-11 08:13:19	Raven67854	I'm really surprised they have Go support
2016-03-11 08:13:20	DerRidda	But you can get everything running that compiles down to an ELF.
2016-03-11 08:13:29	DerRidda	Raven67854: It's broken though.
2016-03-11 08:13:33	DerRidda	Hilalriously so.
2016-03-11 08:13:33	falsaber1	the elvenkind
2016-03-11 08:13:47	Raven67854	You can also quite easily add java/mono apps if you wanted too. Or even python
2016-03-11 08:13:56	falsaber1	santa's favorite executable format
2016-03-11 08:14:00	Raven67854	Canonical doesn't limit you
2016-03-11 08:14:11	DerRidda	They depend on a Go QML lib that is one version behind the latest one, doesn't compile and even the latest one is no longer maintained and also doesn't compile.
2016-03-11 08:14:31	Raven67854	DerRidda, Should be removed then. I haven't used it. I just use QML
2016-03-11 08:14:55	DerRidda	Yeah, there are other Go Qt libs that might work but the template is wank.

2016-03-11 08:16:19	HER0_01	It just isn't very fun to get working
2016-03-11 08:16:41	Raven67854	I've used it by itself int he desktop space and it works fairly well there. As it should since it was meant for servers.
2016-03-11 08:16:52	Raven67854	Not really a fan of it though
2016-03-11 08:17:07	Raven67854	Would much rather use Rust <3
2016-03-11 08:17:11	slapin	as soon as one of the solutions to provide ability to run android apps on arm linux works, I will move from nokia n900 to a newer phone with hardware keyboard
2016-03-11 08:17:42	Raven67854	So go with sailfish
2016-03-11 08:17:50	Raven67854	They have an android layer
2016-03-11 08:18:04	DerRidda	Go seems like a nice choice for decent performance while not caring about memory management and the standard lib is fairly feature rich, you can get quite the app going with minimal additional dependencies.
2016-03-11 08:18:31	Raven67854	Go and Rust are starting to have a huge # of libs ready to go on their "package managers"

2016-03-11 08:18:54	Raven67854	Pretty much anything you can want exists in some form
2016-03-11 08:19:16	DerRidda	Also every language now needs multiple return values without wrapping them up in tuples or other objects.
2016-03-11 08:19:39	DerRidda	That's a thing every other language may copy from Go right now please.
2016-03-11 08:20:22	falsaber1	eh, returning an array or tuple isn't that much of a big deal
2016-03-11 08:20:56	 - 	falsaber1 is now known as falsaber
2016-03-11 08:21:37	DerRidda	It isn't but apparently neither is having multiple return values and those have less overhead and are more intuitive once you get used to it.
2016-03-11 08:21:50	slapin	Raven67854: well, their device is expensive one, have no keyboard, very closed and proprietary, and they have not secured future, they promise many things, but remembering Nokia, you can beleive only what they do now.
2016-03-11 08:21:57	falsaber	a lot of people is going to put those return values into an array, table or tuple anyway
2016-03-11 08:22:02	DerRidda	Though I'm not a Go guy (yet), I will definitely delve deeper into it given the time.
2016-03-11 08:22:40	Raven67854	slapin, All you said was Linux that can run android apps. You weren't very specific
2016-03-11 08:23:01	slapin	Raven67854: well I said I need keyboard

2016-03-11 08:23:25	DerRidda	That limits your selection to 2 phones or so.
2016-03-11 08:23:25	Raven67854	can hook it up to a monitor with keyboard/mouse it's great
2016-03-11 08:23:39	falsaber	so for most use cases, returning one of those is the most sensible option, a lot of people will be using that taplerray (table tuple or array) anyway so it even saves steps
2016-03-11 08:24:06	slapin	Raven67854: also, open source allows self-support for the device, companies come and go, as long as you have spare parts and source code you can support your phone for a long time
2016-03-11 08:24:15	DerRidda	That falls flat on its face when the values are of different types.
2016-03-11 08:24:28	Raven67854	slapin, Well Ubuntu Phone is your best bet then
2016-03-11 08:24:29	falsaber	how so?
2016-03-11 08:25:02	falsaber	a lot of languages allow returning structs, tables can hold multiple types in languages like Lua, so can a gdscript dictionary or a python tuple
2016-03-11 08:25:18	DerRidda	Arrays of different types, unless in a dynamic language are a silly idea, at that point you use Tuples just to be able to do it at all not for anything beyond that.
2016-03-11 08:25:52	falsaber	if you are in a strongly typed language then just have it return a struct then

2016-03-11 08:34:34	Divlji	Tybobobo_, about reference question, String& is a string reference. It's similar to String* but it's automatically dereferenced for you. As in you don't need to use '->' or (*var).somethig(). There are differences between references and pointers, but at this point, ignore them.
2016-03-11 08:35:07	Tybobobo_	Ah
2016-03-11 08:35:38	Tybobobo_	But what difference is there between String& varname and String &varname?
2016-03-11 08:35:40	Divlji	Tybobobo_, const keyword is... Interesting. It's read from right to left but if there is nothing to the left of it then it applies to the thing that is right of it.

2016-03-11 08:38:40	Divlji	Tybobobo_, deal with String &var is that & and * in declarations apply only to the first thing after them. So String &ref, *pointer, object; declares 1 reference to String, one pointer to String and one String object.

2016-03-11 12:39:06	Bran_	masonjoyers i guess u can just get the parent affine inverse and do a xform on the matrix u wan't
2016-03-11 12:39:08	masonjoyers	not seeing a global->local function
2016-03-11 12:39:29	Bran_	masonjoyers there's none
2016-03-11 12:39:50	masonjoyers	i was thinking clone my actor transform, make it look at the point in question then determin the rotation
2016-03-11 12:40:19	masonjoyers	essentially i need to know if the point in question is + or - z from the current position
2016-03-11 12:41:25	masonjoyers	so if the point is +z there wouldn't be much rotation, if it -z there would be about 180 degrees of rotation
2016-03-11 12:42:05	*	masonjoyers so wishes there was a get_velocity() for Vehicles
2016-03-11 12:43:42	Bran_	well my english is not good so i didn't understand that.
2016-03-11 12:43:54	Bran_	u can just get the delta of the position
2016-03-11 12:43:59	masonjoyers	yes
2016-03-11 12:43:59	Bran_	for the velocity
2016-03-11 12:44:11	masonjoyers	but i need to know if the car is moving forward or backward
2016-03-11 12:44:47	masonjoyers	i already sorted out how to get the velocity and scaled to units that make sense.
2016-03-11 12:45:02	masonjoyers	but now i need to know if it going forward or backward
2016-03-11 12:45:20	Bran_	get an foward vector, the transform it with the global transformation of the vehicle the u can do a dot product with the velocity
2016-03-11 12:45:45	Bran_	with velocity normalized of course
2016-03-11 12:46:12	Bran_	var foward = get_global_transform().basis.xform(Vector3(1, 0, 0))
2016-03-11 12:46:43	Bran_	the dot product will return an angle... the cos
2016-03-11 12:46:49	masonjoyers	forward should be Vector3(0, 0, 1)?
2016-03-11 12:46:53	Bran_	yes
2016-03-11 12:46:57	Bran_	-1
2016-03-11 12:47:05	masonjoyers	right

2016-03-11 17:47:10	vsrinu26f	Please help
2016-03-11 17:47:59	dc1a0	well, can't you simply use get_pos() to get the position?
2016-03-11 17:48:55	dc1a0	but from the looks of it, it looks like you might be making things harder on yourself. What exactly are you trying to accomplish?

2016-03-11 17:52:11	vsrinu26f	viewport scaling is degrading my sprite
2016-03-11 17:52:41	vsrinu26f	so I disabled viewport scaling and handling scaling myself as per aspect ratio
2016-03-11 17:53:00	dc1a0	well as you scale the viewport all things get smaller, I'm guessing you want the background to scale but not the sprite?
2016-03-11 17:53:47	Calinou	I don't think anyone should use viewport scaling today :|
2016-03-11 17:53:52	vsrinu26f	my background is a seemless one keeps moving in a parallax
2016-03-11 17:54:10	vsrinu26f	so I dont care about background scaling
2016-03-11 17:55:10	dc1a0	why Calinou? have there been other issues I've not been paying attention to?
2016-03-11 17:56:16	dc1a0	I think, usually the easiest solution is to use a camera node and scale that in most cases. If you want the sprite to scale, have the camera above your sprite, if you want the scene to scale without the sprite have the camera below the sprite in the hierarchy
2016-03-11 17:56:40	Calinou	it looks terrible
2016-03-11 17:56:43	dc1a0	zoom would be the correct term for the camera
2016-03-11 17:57:21	dc1a0	I think it's more how it's applied Calinou, I agree I wouldn't make things bigger, but if you want to make things smaller it seems to do alright Calinou

2016-03-11 17:57:53	Calinou	use "2d" scaling to make GUI elements smaller or larger
2016-03-11 17:58:09	vsrinu26f	oh ok I am yet to use and learn camera, this is my first app and learning godot too :)
2016-03-11 17:58:23	Calinou	even then I wouldn't recommend it as it makes fonts blurry or pixelated
2016-03-11 17:58:52	dc1a0	My project is my first app too but I've learned a lot slipping original scope and turning it into a monster...lol
2016-03-11 17:59:02	vsrinu26f	yes 2d scaling is what I guess I am doing manually :)
2016-03-11 17:59:13	vsrinu26f	I will check that too
2016-03-11 17:59:49	Calinou	Godot 3.0 should get g-buffer scaling so that one can use degraded 3D rendering for better performance, without affecting HUD elements
2016-03-11 18:00:02	dc1a0	I wouldn't use either for text Calinou. I agree. but I wouldn't use sprites in place of fonts in that case either.
2016-03-11 18:02:14	dc1a0	When I get to polishing, I'll be making 3 font sizes for the things I scale, and choose the one to display based upon that scale. I don't right now in my project, but the game portion has so little text it's not important right now.
2016-03-11 18:03:08	vsrinu26f	My alphabets are actually spritesheet 200ppi. Is 300ppi generally used? or what is general recommendation.

2016-03-11 18:05:11	dc1a0	If it was me, after I knew what sizes I'd need, I'd turn it into a fnt file. It seems using sprites like that could get taxing quick I'd think.
2016-03-11 18:05:14	vsrinu26f	I did not believed my eyes when my phone needed such high ppi to show decent on screen
2016-03-11 18:05:47	vsrinu26f	it is telugu, can I still create a fnt file ?
2016-03-11 18:06:46	vsrinu26f	its not english again I have some understanding of shaders, but I have done manually as image for now
2016-03-11 18:07:00	vsrinu26f	in inkscape
2016-03-11 18:07:46	dc1a0	I don't imagine a reason you wouldn't be able to. A font is basically a graphical representation formatted a certain way to the best of my knowledge. That said I'm not an expert in fonts or languages.
2016-03-11 18:09:04	vsrinu26f	the problem is a character is made with one to about 5 characters
2016-03-11 18:09:18	vsrinu26f	they will not be placed side by side horizantally
2016-03-11 18:09:23	dc1a0	I figure if chinese and japanese characters can be put into a font, I don't see why telugu or any other language couldn't
2016-03-11 18:09:56	vsrinu26f	such kind of things, so some sort of processing or engine kind of thing has to be there, I am just wondering if that will work in godot
2016-03-11 18:10:13	vsrinu26f	oh ok then it will work for telugu too

2016-03-11 18:12:03	vsrinu26f	so, 300 ppi and scale up from there or 200 ppi and scale up from there  ( tablets, tv's)
2016-03-11 18:13:37	dc1a0	Calinou, you might have better advise on scaling text than I would.

2016-03-11 18:19:30	dc1a0	vsrinu26f, was asking about a proper initial ppi for a spritesheet they're thinking of turning into a font YeOldeDM. I figured you might have some expertise in that area. I've changed files to fnt files but never even looked at how big they were to start with.

2016-03-11 20:52:17	paolobb4	I am using the better collada plugin.
2016-03-11 20:59:03	paolobb4	ok, so I just noticed that they were created as concave shapes instead of convex shapes.
2016-03-11 21:02:49	paolobb4	didn't find any options on the import menu to indicate them as convex. Do I have to do something different in blender before exporting?
