2016-03-02 09:20:44	Michael	our car spot out the front is in between two trees and a roof gutter with a power line coming out from the roof to the street power line
2016-03-02 09:20:48	Michael	so bird shit galore
2016-03-02 09:20:51	Michael	:S
2016-03-02 09:21:09	fsociety	maybe not have a day like that though.. haha
2016-03-02 09:21:22	Michael	oh mang 2015 was like that for me... I really don't have any plans to make this permanent
2016-03-02 09:21:28	Michael	I need to work asap
2016-03-02 09:21:44	Michael	so i'm looking for anything... heck even couriering :)¬†
2016-03-02 09:21:57	fsociety	yeah dude it industry is fucked
2016-03-02 09:22:11	Michael	you know
2016-03-02 09:22:37	Michael	I have been giving completing a traineeship for Telecommunications serious thought
2016-03-02 09:22:49	Michael	I actually did prior to starting at this TSA company till I got the job
2016-03-02 09:22:50	fsociety	that's crap
2016-03-02 09:23:30	Michael	as Telstra had many Traineeships beginning 2016... but unfortunately as it's early March they've already begun and I would need to start mid year¬†
2016-03-02 09:23:58	Michael	It's completing a Trainesship in Cert III Telecomunications or Cert IV Telecomunication (Network Design)
2016-03-02 09:24:07	Michael	and going back asa mature age trainee
2016-03-02 09:24:13	Michael	you get about $700 a week
2016-03-02 09:24:52	Michael	and complete it in 24 months... upon which the company you completed the traineeship usually have limited positions available
2016-03-02 09:25:13	Michael	I thought work while I learn sure why not... and then get into the industry and bobs your uncle
2016-03-02 09:25:30	Michael	and I know what your thinking... Cert III or Cert IV wtf?
2016-03-02 09:25:41	Michael	it seems a little... underwhemling you could say heh
2016-03-02 09:26:00	Michael	But I guess it's because it's more hands on kinda like a trade - being out in the field
2016-03-02 09:26:29	Michael	so advanced theory / classrom excercises isn't really required as more on the job experience
2016-03-02 09:26:35	fsociety	start your own windows development for small businesses :)
2016-03-02 09:27:15	Michael	I'm not that advanced in the windows environment heh
2016-03-02 09:27:34	Michael	I had my first tastes of Server 2012 and Exchange 2012 etc at this new company
2016-03-02 09:27:52	Michael	even Windows 8 Enterprise actually hehe
2016-03-02 09:28:01	Michael	I'm lagging so far behind in knowledge
2016-03-02 09:28:21	Michael	(i'm quite capable of learning fast)¬†
2016-03-02 09:29:22	Michael	but i'm just sayin'... this new gen of folks graduating frmo using t he latest and best in &quot;Microsoft&quot; orientated products... I would be trailing behind a little perhaps... :S... maybe¬†
2016-03-02 09:31:54	fsociety	pfft.. ppl "graduating".. anybody that studies a microsoft certificate or even a linux course will never have a long standing job
2016-03-02 09:31:54	 - 	[Michael] is away: Mobile
2016-03-02 09:32:04	fsociety	they don't know how to problem solve, need to be spoon fed
2016-03-02 09:32:29	fsociety	amusing how a lot of high profile companies look for what essentially are "whitehat hackers".. people who learnt through trial and error
2016-03-02 09:35:49	Michael	lol
2016-03-02 09:35:51	Michael	true
2016-03-02 09:36:46	fsociety	so im grabbing my spare black drive off my friend tonight and then putting the rma for that black drive in tomorrow
2016-03-02 09:36:50	fsociety	it has a 5-yr warranty :)
2016-03-02 09:37:41	Michael	but you know the manager's from the last couple companies I worked at (and yes the dush companies - i.e. Toll TCS and TSA) lol I know when they were searching for new candidates the thing that 'mesmerized' management was certifications. Especially if you had this and that and this and that.... lol basically every letter of the alphabet type list of certfications...¬†
2016-03-02 09:37:50	Michael	it'd be the main thing that would of wowed them
2016-03-02 09:38:10	Michael	Experience came second I guess lol
2016-03-02 09:38:37	Michael	...and I guess it just shows the company's quality :P

2016-03-02 09:48:48	fsociety	*face palm*
2016-03-02 09:49:04	Michael	I think I had 4 of them hehe
2016-03-02 09:49:21	Michael	the blu ray died twice on 2 separate ones
2016-03-02 09:49:38	Michael	well once it died
2016-03-02 09:50:17	fsociety	really - wow
2016-03-02 09:50:20	Michael	another one it wasn't reading it right like the disk would be hitting a side when it spun around so it's like the chasis was wrong
2016-03-02 09:50:54	Michael	and when it was loading it would do large clinks every now and then and would lock the game up constantly
2016-03-02 09:50:56	Michael	lol
2016-03-02 09:51:06	Michael	yeah I had many troubles with the PS3
2016-03-02 09:51:57	Michael	one of them my housemate at the time was playing one of the CoD games all day long every day whilst I was at work
2016-03-02 09:52:05	Michael	and I would come home and play it also
2016-03-02 09:52:58	Michael	apparently I heard that with the slim line PS3s or something they don't have sufficient fans or something like that and so evry like hour or two of gaming you need to stop and let it cool for 15 minutes else it would burn out
2016-03-02 09:53:08	fsociety	i've never had an issue with my slim line
2016-03-02 09:53:10	fsociety	its 6 years old
2016-03-02 09:53:39	fsociety	sounds like you are talking about the old xbox 360s haha
2016-03-02 09:53:42	Michael	hmmm potato potAhtoe
2016-03-02 09:53:46	Michael	:P
2016-03-02 09:54:05	Michael	hehe just like the poor sods buying an xbox and getting the ring of death
2016-03-02 09:54:25	Michael	hmmm not red ring of death
2016-03-02 09:54:30	Michael	there was a name for it though
2016-03-02 09:54:47	Michael	affected alot of Xboxs but not all
2016-03-02 09:56:30	fsociety	hahaha.. consoles are meh these days.. every aspect i liked about a console has been thrown out the window
2016-03-02 09:56:43	fsociety	consoles now require patches, firmware updates, os upgrades, hard drive installations
2016-03-02 09:56:53	fsociety	removes every aspect on what made a console appealing
2016-03-02 10:59:11	Michael	lol wellz... as they say Its no longer a 'game console' instead now they're 'home entertainment systems'¬†
2016-03-02 10:59:13	Michael	hehe :P
2016-03-02 10:59:29	fsociety	oh your back :)
2016-03-02 10:59:36	Michael	:P
2016-03-02 10:59:44	Michael	I'm never too far away
2016-03-02 11:01:20	Michael	I'm going to call Legal Aid - specifically Vic Uni Legal (guessing law students) hehe - but yeah before writing back to the HR representative from TSA I want to make sure that what I'll reply with is plausible and if i should bother pursuing the case
2016-03-02 11:01:28	Michael	You know
2016-03-02 11:02:56	Michael	I still have no documentation relating to the termination... Something even as basic as The Employment separation certficate I don't have... I still don't have any formal letter advising of my termination... and finally... and i mean finally I got paid out my entitlements for which I assume is for my termination
2016-03-02 11:03:50	Michael	but hey... because I don't have any documents I don't even know what the payment is for exactly... You know as per my calculations they actually stuffed up by about 1 or 2 days pay
2016-03-02 11:04:29	Michael	I got less then what I calculated by exactly a day to which I assume they probably didn't calculate the last day I attended for half the day which was the 16th of Feb...¬†
2016-03-02 11:05:07	Michael	but hey if this was all proper and legitmate to begin with I'd already have a document stating this information :/
2016-03-02 11:05:24	Michael	So my dilemma is:
2016-03-02 11:06:41	fsociety	yuuusss
2016-03-02 11:09:18	Michael	Thursday the HR rep sent me an email saying that she's attempted to contact me regarding my email and that should I wish to discuss the matter further to call her on the work phone / office line.
2016-03-02 11:09:41	Michael	so basically I can state what I mentioned to you but on a much mroe professional level
2016-03-02 11:09:44	Michael	ALTHOUGH
2016-03-02 11:10:00	Michael	what troubles me is the fact she's wanting me to cal her :S
2016-03-02 11:10:33	Michael	I don't understand why she wants me to call her... I really think for serious matters like this there should be some formal documentation especially now
2016-03-02 11:10:56	Michael	heck I didn't have any to begin with and now there trying to keep anything from being on record??
2016-03-02 11:11:34	Michael	So yeah IF i call legal service to obtain some info... I'll see if i should reply via email stating what I want to state again or if infact I should call her back
2016-03-02 11:11:47	Michael	and as she said... to 'discuss' the matter further
2016-03-02 11:12:13	Michael	whats there to discuss... is one of the first things that's running through my mind
2016-03-02 11:12:41	Michael	secondly why hasn't she followed anything up that I requested such as my separation certificate, termination letter? entitlement letter?
2016-03-02 11:13:10	Michael	surely she could have replied in a an email and then concluded by saying if I wish to discuss the matter further to call her...
2016-03-02 11:13:44	Michael	not to say nothing, reply with nothing, and to call her to discuss my issues further?? like wtf
2016-03-02 11:15:44	fsociety	just threaten legal action in your emails.. that will usually push them along quickly
2016-03-02 11:15:47	fsociety	thats what i usually do :)
2016-03-02 11:16:29	Michael	well the main thing I'm quite certain I got the last payment which had my annual leave and one week's payment in lieu
2016-03-02 11:17:09	Michael	so threatening them I would actually have to threaten them with going to the fair work comission¬†
2016-03-02 11:18:50	Michael	I guess looking at it deeper now... There's really two sides to this story.... two sides from my point of view I mean :P hehe
2016-03-02 11:18:53	Michael	basically...
2016-03-02 11:20:52	Michael	I need to engage with this HR rep to obtain official documents for my termination. This way I can then apply for centrelink as I have the required forms to do so etc¬†
2016-03-02 11:21:25	fsociety	just have to be forceful at this point otherwise those corps will just put you on the backburner
2016-03-02 11:22:11	Michael	But while I'm obtaining the documents I need to also somehow make mention that this whole termination has been unlawful as it was enacted under an unjust reason
2016-03-02 11:22:33	Michael	argh I need to call legal service
2016-03-02 11:22:35	Michael	I'll do that
2016-03-02 11:22:37	Michael	bbs
