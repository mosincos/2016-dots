2016-01-24 13:50:08	runciter	of course, but it's dumb to put some unnamed numeric literal there
2016-01-24 13:50:09	Vainglory	so if someone is using km, it needs to be converted to ensure points are given equally among the two
2016-01-24 13:50:15	runciter	this is known as a magic number
2016-01-24 13:50:29	tos9	Vainglory: Defining Exception.__init__ is not very nice, especially without calling super. You've also got a large number of conditionals, which is often a sign that you don't have enough objects. You're also assigning to random attributes of objects, which isn't typically a thing you should do.
2016-01-24 13:50:36	autrilla	Vainglory: you should have a method used to convert between units

2016-01-24 13:52:10	autrilla	runciter: I think def km_to_miles(km): return km * 1.6 is better than giving the magic number a name and multiplying every time
2016-01-24 13:52:14	altendky	Vainglory: in did_i_get_points() you could shift to a dict something more akin to {'Run':3, 'Jog':10, 'Walk':15} (not exactly but create an association between the values and ranges)

2016-01-24 14:52:06	Raynes	Hey guys. I've been hacking Python for ages and was just taken aback a bit by a bit of syntax in Python source code that I can't figure out for the life of me what it's doing, nor can my also-Pythonista roommie. Particularly, this line: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/asyncio/queues.py#L41
2016-01-24 14:52:14	Raynes	What on earth is that asterisk doing there?
2016-01-24 14:52:21	PovAddict	o.o
2016-01-24 14:52:23	PovAddict	that's news to me too
2016-01-24 14:52:34	Raynes	I've been trying to figure it out in a repl but dis isn't helping
2016-01-24 14:52:38	Raynes	It's like it's not even there.
2016-01-24 14:52:40	PovAddict	I mean
2016-01-24 14:52:43	Raynes	I don't get it and it's bothering me lol
2016-01-24 14:52:46	PovAddict	*foo means get all other arguments into a list
2016-01-24 14:52:52	PovAddict	but an asterisk alone with no arg name?
2016-01-24 14:53:03	Raynes	oYeah
2016-01-24 14:53:13	Raynes	That's what's blowing my mind.
2016-01-24 14:53:18	_habnabit	Raynes, it means 'every argument after this can only be specified by name'
2016-01-24 14:53:31	Raynes	Oh thank goodness

2016-01-24 15:32:52	_habnabit	Tophat, use a template engine like mako
2016-01-24 15:33:06	_habnabit	thedangler, is this for debugging?
2016-01-24 15:33:25	jaziz	Is there something like // that records the ceiling of the quotient?

2016-01-24 15:34:04	jaziz	gotcha
2016-01-24 15:34:11	_habnabit	thedangler, so you can debug it...?
2016-01-24 15:34:35	KirkMcDonald	jaziz: You can also use divmod, and add 1 if the modulus is nonzero.
2016-01-24 15:34:48	Tophat	_habnabit: mako?
2016-01-24 15:34:52	_habnabit	Tophat, mako
2016-01-24 15:35:00	jaziz	KirkMcDonald, is divmod the %?
2016-01-24 15:35:03	Tophat	uh-oh better get mako
2016-01-24 15:35:07	KirkMcDonald	jaziz: divmod() is a builtin function.
