2016-03-13 12:10:11	NicholasB	their laptops are solid.
2016-03-13 12:11:04	Sean	Yeah thats why i started running linux on it because after Lion it was unsecure, but it was still a good laptop. Didn't want to pitch it if it still ran well.
2016-03-13 12:12:13	Sean	Just finding the Broadcom wireless hookup was a pain in the ass.
2016-03-13 12:12:52	NicholasB	ahh yeah. fkn broadcom
2016-03-13 12:35:39	Joe	What about the sound?

2016-03-13 12:36:13	Joe	In OS X at least
2016-03-13 12:36:24	Joe	In Linux they are tinny and shit
2016-03-13 12:36:53	Joe	popey said it's something to do with the settings but I've never spent enough time figuring it out
2016-03-13 12:39:47	NicholasB	hmm ive never noticecd sound in linux
2016-03-13 12:40:04	NicholasB	i use a dac to external speakers if i care
2016-03-13 12:47:26	NicholasB	@kloinka fuck me thats better than webcamstudio.
2016-03-13 12:47:47	NicholasB	maybe not for everything but i was getting 3 frames a sercond ouf of that.
2016-03-13 12:56:04	EricT	It has good devs, and progressed well since 2014

2016-03-13 14:12:25	NicholasB	ha
2016-03-13 14:12:30	NicholasB	fucktard i am
2016-03-13 14:18:52	Joe	You don't have to be a fat 30something with a beard to do a Linux podcast but it helps
2016-03-13 14:19:02	Joe	Put that on a bumper sticker
2016-03-13 14:19:04	NicholasB	no. you do
2016-03-13 14:19:10	NicholasB	all the others are faking.

2016-03-13 14:21:21	Joe	So having bought the domain I had a brain fart of an idea

2016-03-13 14:21:57	NicholasB	ha. im more attentive in the next video
2016-03-13 14:23:17	EricT	He's not the Messiah!
2016-03-13 14:23:46	NicholasB	tell us your idea
2016-03-13 14:23:47	Joe	What if FOSS Talk was a show that was recorded live over Skype (or similar) every couple of weeks and featured a rotating cast of various Linux podcasters talking about issues of the day. Almost no preparation would be required. Just turn up at a certain time, talk shit for an hour or so and hang up
2016-03-13 14:23:47	NicholasB	joe
2016-03-13 14:24:03	NicholasB	could work.
2016-03-13 14:24:05	Joe	No editing, no bullshit
2016-03-13 14:24:15	Joe	No local recordings
2016-03-13 14:24:22	NicholasB	id only do it if i can route my green screen to skype though.
2016-03-13 14:24:26	NicholasB	i want to be in a library

2016-03-13 14:25:56	Joe	As I said, it's a brain fart
2016-03-13 14:26:06	NicholasB	its not a badd brain fart
2016-03-13 14:26:58	Joe	It might steal content away from the various people's proper shows though
2016-03-13 14:27:06	NicholasB	wouldnt worry us.
2016-03-13 14:27:08	NicholasB	we have no content
2016-03-13 14:28:09	Joe	One to think about
2016-03-13 14:28:22	NicholasB	indeed.
2016-03-13 14:28:53	Joe	You know when you went on Ubuntu Podcast
2016-03-13 14:29:01	NicholasB	yah

2016-03-13 14:32:04	NicholasB	self contracotr
2016-03-13 14:32:10	Joe	I suppose I could pay myself not to go to work
2016-03-13 14:32:14	Sean	If I was my own boss I would at least take a month off and travel.
2016-03-13 14:32:19	Joe	But my company wouldn't make anything
2016-03-13 14:32:32	NicholasB	i get longservice leave also.

2016-03-13 14:33:04	NicholasB	yes yes mr teacher
2016-03-13 14:33:12	Sean	Damn capitalist America!
2016-03-13 14:33:23	NicholasB	do teachers get paid vacations in the usa?
2016-03-13 14:33:30	NicholasB	they'd have to surely
2016-03-13 14:33:51	Sean	Nope. They get paid a full years wage for only working the school year.
2016-03-13 14:34:12	Joe	In the UK teachers get 12 monthly payments
2016-03-13 14:34:17	Joe	All equal
2016-03-13 14:34:23	NicholasB	id hate monthy wages
2016-03-13 14:34:28	NicholasB	forthnightly is irritating enough
2016-03-13 14:34:58	Joe	There is a month in the summer where they don't work but still get a payment
2016-03-13 14:35:00	Sean	Well they work 180-ish days. I think they would get personal days, but the summer months off they don't get paid
2016-03-13 14:36:23	Sean	In the factory I work in there are two weeks of shutdown (July 4th and Christmas) we get a couple paid holidays but the rest are unpaid. Nothing like forced unpaid vacations.
2016-03-13 14:36:42	NicholasB	i work over christmas
2016-03-13 14:36:43	NicholasB	its great
2016-03-13 14:36:51	NicholasB	my office is so quiet its like im doing nothing.
2016-03-13 14:37:21	Joe	Right seriously bed
2016-03-13 14:37:43	Sean	Night!
2016-03-13 14:37:47	NicholasB	night night
2016-03-13 14:38:02	Sean	Speaking of I should go too. Daylight savings ends tonight.
2016-03-13 14:38:09	NicholasB	ohhh
2016-03-13 14:38:16	NicholasB	we have 2 weeks before its done
2016-03-13 14:38:19	NicholasB	cant wait.
2016-03-13 16:30:24	NotDan	One of my lecturers insists on providing lecture videos via Adobe Flash only...
2016-03-13 16:30:44	NotDan	Green screen is looking pretty good @enjayembee
2016-03-13 16:31:05	NicholasB	ahh yeah i was tinkering with formats.
2016-03-13 16:31:09	NicholasB	im pretty happy
2016-03-13 16:31:18	NicholasB	i have to have a think out how i approach it.
2016-03-13 16:31:35	NicholasB	i some how have to get dans camin there as well
2016-03-13 16:31:51	NotDan	So you wont both be at the same location?
2016-03-13 16:32:00	NicholasB	no dan is moving
2016-03-13 16:32:03	NotDan	Ah
2016-03-13 16:32:08	NotDan	That sounds challenging
2016-03-13 16:32:10	NicholasB	it will all be remote from now on.
2016-03-13 16:32:13	NicholasB	audio and video
2016-03-13 16:32:46	NicholasB	we'll work it. audio should be okay. record locally and we'll just use a shitty hang out so we dont get obvious lag
2016-03-13 16:33:14	NotDan	any ideas on your intended green screen backdrop
2016-03-13 16:33:22	NicholasB	im a flaky human
2016-03-13 16:33:24	NicholasB	it will change
2016-03-13 16:33:25	NotDan	or will it be a kind of 'whos line is it anyway' style
2016-03-13 16:33:34	NicholasB	well i will ahve to do some preprep
2016-03-13 16:33:55	NicholasB	its not something you can do super on the fly with out me starting off camera for an extended period
2016-03-13 16:34:05	NotDan	yeah, fair enough
2016-03-13 16:34:29	NicholasB	hows your weekend
2016-03-13 16:34:35	NicholasB	you get a long weekend in WA?
2016-03-13 16:34:41	NotDan	we did last weekend
2016-03-13 16:35:08	NotDan	i went out friday night, so saturday was spent recovering. today has been productive though
2016-03-13 16:35:10	NotDan	yourself?
2016-03-13 16:35:18	NicholasB	i did about the same.
2016-03-13 16:35:36	NicholasB	was struggling with the greens cren last night till @kloinka pointed me to software
2016-03-13 16:35:44	NicholasB	so have been tinkering with that and watching american dad
2016-03-13 16:35:53	NotDan	nice
2016-03-13 16:35:58	NotDan	gotten into rick and morty at all?
2016-03-13 16:36:06	NotDan	i was watching that last night, in addition to 'the wire'
2016-03-13 16:36:11	NicholasB	i watched em all (while on the net browsing)
2016-03-13 16:36:20	NicholasB	i might watch again. seem salright.
2016-03-13 16:36:21	EricT	That's why we are a community! ðŸ˜Š
2016-03-13 16:36:28	NicholasB	indeed.
2016-03-13 16:36:44	NicholasB	the only thing it doesnt' do is create a virtual camera
2016-03-13 16:36:50	NicholasB	so i can't use it for google hangout etc
2016-03-13 16:36:54	NotDan	<br><img id="16">
2016-03-13 16:37:50	NotDan	did the original program at 3fps have that option?
2016-03-13 16:37:57	NicholasB	yeah
2016-03-13 16:39:00	NotDan	yeah that is disappointing
2016-03-13 16:41:32	LewisCividin	off topic http://kotaku.com/the-seven-samurai-looks-glorious-in-4k-1761457283
2016-03-13 16:41:39	EricT	Yo can ask the guys at LGC, they got it worked out, ask Venn on the chat, they on irc and playing a game of cards against humanity now.
2016-03-13 16:41:39	EricT	https://linuxgamecast.com/live/
2016-03-13 16:42:40	NicholasB	sweet
2016-03-13 16:43:08	LewisCividin	yeah I'm a huge fan of Kurosawa's films
2016-03-13 16:43:13	NicholasB	i will if i get stuck.  i have a few ideas
2016-03-13 16:43:27	NicholasB	need to wait to dans back from music festivals to try it :P
2016-03-13 16:44:13	LewisCividin	so you can't pipe obs to virtual cam?
2016-03-13 16:44:42	NicholasB	nah it appears it can only output as a file or connect to streaming services
2016-03-13 16:44:55	NicholasB	a thread on the forum seem to say hey im not doing it atm.
2016-03-13 16:45:02	NicholasB	one of you can write the code and ill merge it
2016-03-13 16:45:19	NotDan	is there a deadline
2016-03-13 16:47:12	LewisCividin	yeah my google fu suggests fuck around
2016-03-13 16:47:49	NicholasB	nah no deadline. its not the end of the world. at the end of the day dan doesnt have to see all that shit on my end. he just has to see me.
2016-03-13 16:48:25	NicholasB	the out put is the most important bit.
2016-03-13 16:48:38	LewisCividin	you could pipe the output into vlc maybe and broadcast through that?
