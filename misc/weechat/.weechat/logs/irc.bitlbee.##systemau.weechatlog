2016-02-18 12:29:35	@fsociety	welcome to the rabbit hole
2016-02-18 12:30:02	Sean	I thought it was pretty roomy.
2016-02-18 12:30:25	@fsociety	leave your phone not on silent and you will soon discover
2016-02-18 12:30:28	NicholasB	No problem Sean. Not much has changed. Lots of shit talk and links :)
2016-02-18 12:30:35	NicholasB	I still recommend turning off notifications.
2016-02-18 12:30:51	Sean	Already did :)
2016-02-18 12:31:17	NicholasB	smart man.
2016-02-18 12:31:29	NicholasB	sometimes i wake up and there alite 300 missed messages
2016-02-18 12:32:00	Sean	So what you're saying is you've become a speed reader
2016-02-18 12:34:39	NicholasB	nah. a speed ignorer. :P
2016-02-18 12:35:20	NicholasB	Hows Indiana?
2016-02-18 12:35:26	NicholasB	that's your loc isn' tit
2016-02-18 12:35:33	NicholasB	or am i getting people confused.
2016-02-18 12:36:58	Sean	Yep. Its not too bad. Normal cold February. Can't wait until spring. Well, my spring, your fall :)
2016-02-18 12:38:19	NicholasB	its already cold today for feb. which is normally pretty warm out here
2016-02-18 12:38:25	NicholasB	all gloomy.
2016-02-18 12:39:32	Sean	Damn climate change
2016-02-18 12:39:59	Sean	Well you have a new season of footy to look forward to ;)
2016-02-18 12:41:05	Sean	I actually like footy because its different. American Football is so boring here.
2016-02-18 12:41:30	NicholasB	i'm not a big footy fan. but geelong is a huge football town\
2016-02-18 12:41:37	NicholasB	i live near the stadium
2016-02-18 12:41:44	Sean	Also too many armchair commentators. No one really like to talk tech.
2016-02-18 12:42:46	Sean	Although I did get someone to switch from Windows to Ubuntu Unity. Pretty stoked about that. So far he likes it.
2016-02-18 12:42:54	NicholasB	oh sweet.
2016-02-18 12:43:07	NicholasB	i'm gunna get my little sister on to it by the end of the year
2016-02-18 12:43:11	NicholasB	even if its dual boot :)
2016-02-18 12:43:16	NicholasB	its my goal.
2016-02-18 12:43:23	Sean	Nice!
2016-02-18 12:43:54	Sean	He upgraded to 10 and got super pissed at it and was done with Windows.
2016-02-18 12:44:15	NicholasB	ha.
2016-02-18 12:44:19	@fsociety	Sean: He likes Unity?
2016-02-18 12:44:21	NicholasB	that's a common story i think.
2016-02-18 12:45:07	Sean	He likes it because he doesn't know different. He might start fiddling around but as a new father he doesn't have much time currently.
2016-02-18 12:45:07		[12:45]
2016-02-18 12:45:44	@fsociety	that makes sense :) i thought maybe going to something more window like - for eg. cinnamon might even help the transition be even smoother
2016-02-18 12:46:54	Sean	I was in the same boat as him when I talked to him about it.
2016-02-18 12:47:29	@fsociety	last two days have been exciting in linux tech land. vulkan and what seems like quite a mature release of wayland
2016-02-18 12:47:32	Sean	Now I use @wimpress distro. My wife likes it too.
2016-02-18 12:47:38	@fsociety	the more i see every itteration of wayland i want to install it
2016-02-18 12:47:53	@fsociety	ahh mate
2016-02-18 12:48:09	Sean	Yep.
2016-02-18 12:48:15	@fsociety	yeah i used that for a little bit, then i went back to normal ways :) but its like using the ubuntu i remember i loved :)
2016-02-18 12:48:30	Sean	Runs so silky smooth for me.
2016-02-18 12:48:55	@fsociety	as everyone else knows. i'm all tiling window managers, and terminal windows these days. my gf complains because she cant use my pc
2016-02-18 12:49:07	Sean	Welp. Gotta get back to work. Later.
2016-02-18 12:49:10	NicholasB	Ahhh Ubuntu Martin as I like to call it.
2016-02-18 12:49:13	NicholasB	Catch ya.
2016-02-18 12:49:18	NicholasB	thanks for popping in .
2016-02-18 12:49:42	Sean	That's why I don't fiddle with mine too much. I'll get a different compy to do my own stuff on.
2016-02-18 12:49:51	@fsociety	more people to add to the collection :)
2016-02-18 12:50:04	@fsociety	NicholasB: though clearly you already knew him quite well
2016-02-18 12:50:27	Sean	I like it :)
2016-02-18 12:52:38	@fsociety	the fact i can now talk in telegram in weechat makes life wonderful
2016-02-18 12:55:08	NicholasB	ive never even heard of weechat.
2016-02-18 12:55:11	NicholasB	ill take a gander
2016-02-18 12:55:17	NicholasB	when i get home if i remember.

2016-02-19 08:23:38	Joe	I've got a Nexus 4 as well
2016-02-19 08:23:43	Joe	It's a great phone

2016-02-19 08:27:52	Joe	It would be good publicity for them
2016-02-19 08:27:54	MartinWimpress	If he turn's up, he'll get on.
2016-02-19 08:27:56	Joe	Good plan
2016-02-19 08:28:09	MartinWimpress	Relay that message to Graham could you?
2016-02-19 08:28:28	MartinWimpress	point him at @m_wimpress on Twitter if he has question about how to join ewtc.
2016-02-19 08:29:00	Joe	Is it Tues at 10pm?

2016-02-19 09:32:33	Moritz	Whoops. Found two 1:45h long recordings on my phone. Didn't know i accidentally recorded myself. ð Weird to hear a big chunk of your day from inside your pocket.

2016-02-19 14:20:27	@fsociety	i've spent all afternoon reading about lennart poettering and now i think i'm slowly becoming a sociopath
2016-02-19 14:21:39	@fsociety	i do love the comment linus made about him though
2016-02-19 14:23:48	@fsociety	Kay, I'm f*cking tired of the fact that you don't fix problems in the code *you* write, so that the kernel then has to work around the problems you causeâ¦ This has been going on for *years*, and doesn't seem to be getting any betterâ¦ I'm not willing to merge something where the maintainer is known to not care about bugs and regressions and then forces people in other projects to fix their
2016-02-19 14:23:48	@fsociety	project. Because I am *not* willing to take patches from people who don't clean up after their problems, and don't admit that it's their problem to fix. Kay - one more time: you caused the problem, you need to fix it. None of this "I can do whatever I want, others have to clean up after me" crap. Linus

2016-02-20 00:57:57	AzzaMatazz	[2016-02-19 22:27:59] Hello! Ah that grey grey voice over gets me every time.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-19 22:28:21] I know that name
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:30:43] well we got gray gray to re do it becuase there are a few name changes.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:30:49] you'll have to listen out next ep. :)
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:30:58] hopefully you are just as satisfied.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	AzzaMatazz	[2016-02-19 22:33:20] I am sure I will be, just finished listening to #25  now.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	AzzaMatazz	[2016-02-19 22:34:08] Oh I forget hash tags aren't numbers anymore.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:34:12] I actually like hearing you say the names... Mainly because you got my last name right. :-)
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:34:35] i think he got it right this time. let me check.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:35:53] may be not perfect
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:36:03] but he's lost the kinch
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:36:14] Oh sweet
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:36:14] and more kinse
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:36:39] That's cool, it's all good. Thanks for checking.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:37:01] no probs. it bugged me too actually. but at the time it was heard to get the whole thing redone.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:37:07] *hard
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:37:54] Yeah I could imagine... Plus with all the names, there are going to be some differences.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:38:12] I'm happy either way
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:38:21] i'm thinking ill get him to redo the list every month now. so its up to date.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:38:35] we used to just cut names in but it was a bit messy.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:38:58] Ohhh, that makes sense
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:39:17] He won't be pissed being asked to do it every month?
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:39:32] we pay him. he charges accordingly.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:39:36] its a job to him.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:39:42] prob doesn';t even know what linux is
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:39:47] Can we send in aliases to be read instead of our real names? Hahahaha
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:05] of course as long as they aren't thinks like dick fart
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:11] we just use whats on patreon
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:26] he wont swear. one of his rules
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:40:36] Sure, I wouldn't send something rude
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:40:50] all good.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	BrentKincer	[2016-02-19 22:41:05] Wow, he's got standards huh?
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:41:15] so are you an aussie local or from dispant shores.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:41:26] *distant. I can't type. It's well known around these parts
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 22:41:50] if i think about i can. @JoeRess said he's stop being so whiny if i learnt to type correctly.

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NotDan	[2016-02-19 23:31:51] I actually like a lot of the tracks on De Rigueurmortis

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 23:42:08] justified

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NotDan	[2016-02-19 23:45:41] The 90s were great for songs that included a random rap in the middle

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NottheOtherDan	[2016-02-19 23:50:21] One of my favourite things is when you Bork your system trying to install proprietary driver at 11:50 PM.
2016-02-20 00:57:57	NicholasB	[2016-02-19 23:51:00] ubuntu?

2016-02-20 00:57:57	NottheOtherDan	[2016-02-19 23:52:34] Kinda gotta read it as walking for the rhyme to really work.

2016-02-20 02:05:44	Moritz	Knowing this I can finally sleep safely.
2016-02-20 02:11:00		[02:05]
2016-02-20 03:43:55	Moritz	After listening to #25 I want that Jono reviews Kawai metal. Maybe a segment in Bad Voltage or so.
2016-02-20 03:43:55		[03:43]
2016-02-20 03:48:06	PaulGleeson	It was great
2016-02-20 03:54:00		[03:48]
2016-02-20 04:01:14	PaulGleeson	How's everyone doing?
2016-02-20 04:04:19	PaulGleeson	Just chillin while waiting on a hotdog and milkshake. Thinking about stuff
2016-02-20 04:10:00		[04:04]
2016-02-20 04:11:36	AlanPope	mmmm hotdogs

2016-02-20 04:21:25	Moritz	Congrats on the great music selection in the last episode. Really enjoying it.
2016-02-20 04:27:00		[04:21]
2016-02-20 06:30:42	MartinWimpress	Good start to Friday evening, my running buddy can't make it.
2016-02-20 06:30:42		[06:30]
2016-02-20 06:30:49	MartinWimpress	I could go running.
2016-02-20 06:31:06	MartinWimpress	Or I could watch Jessica Jones.
2016-02-20 06:31:38	PaulGleeson	Jessica Jones is very good
2016-02-20 06:32:06	MartinWimpress	Yeah, I'm about half way through the season.
2016-02-20 06:38:00		[06:32]
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	ð¡ looked at the website for public transport, it says I need a ticket E. I am late, have to get one in the train, because I only have D and risk getting a fine over 60â¬. The god of the tickets lectures me about entering the train without a ticket. But sells me one anyway. ð°
2016-02-20 07:31:50		[07:31]
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	Realise later that he sold me a D ticket. Get my connection in time. Bus driver double checks my ticket two times. No problem.
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	Either the website is wrong, or the employees don't know the price structure. 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	 
2016-02-20 07:31:50	Moritz	Two people inconvenienced: Ticket god has no change left. I have to pay more for a single ticket D, I already had. I lost my breath as well as my dignity to the ticket god.

2016-02-20 11:32:27	TristanJames	My mate brought around a bottle of the recent winner of best Australian Single Malt yesterday. Had some before we went to Melbs for the soccer and then as a nightcap.

2016-02-20 15:55:41	Joe	[12:56:49] Because of the unrealistic expectations it gives young people
2016-02-20 15:55:41	Joe	[12:57:15] But maybe that's just her pr people saying that stuff and she's really a stupid bitch

2016-02-21 20:41:07	@fsociety	you still trying to use bsd dan?
2016-02-21 20:46:07	Joe	Ghost BSD is by far the easiest
2016-02-21 20:50:37	NotDan	Got my server hardware setup now, so yeah, diving in to the BSD system now

2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:08:26] Ghostbsd is kinda useless
2016-02-22 09:20:53	Joe	[2016-02-21 22:08:40] Why?
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:09:37] Lacks a community to properly test software outside the main system
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:11:38] I've only ever heard non BSD user talk about it
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:12:48] What about Dragonfly?
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:16:21] Dragonfly is just the freebsd pacakages
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:16:29] Like its the same tree
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:17:57] there was a lot of chatter about it a couple of years ago...
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:18:53] For a tiny project it has an insane speed of development
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:19:15] But they had to drop everything but amd64 to get there
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:20:30] OK, I guess suffer from what most &quot;distro&quot; do, not enough development community
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:21:39] Not really most BSDs have plenty if developers but lack a large community of users to break things and make reports
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:21:56] Of*
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:23:56] Don't know enouiigh about the BSDs...tried PCBSD 2 years ago, for about a month, then lost interest though have use PFsense and Monowall on pcengines boards for a while
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:24:25] Pfsense is great
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:24:53] I agree, by far the best opensource firewall
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:25:47] Apparently pf itself is one of the most common pieces of open source software in the world
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:29:13] Im actually thinking of running a vm of pfsense in my classes this term (for firewall, vpn and webproxy) instead of MS forefront TMG (which is a bloated peice of shit) which we have taught since MS ISA 2004 as our &quot;perimeter security and internet gateway&quot;.
2016-02-22 09:20:53	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:30:12] I would, its built to work in pure Microsoft environments
2016-02-22 09:20:53	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:32:32] Now that MS is no longer actively creating the Firewall Server I can use other solution, I had an option for Cisco, but I would prefer opensource.

2016-02-22 09:21:01	MartinWimpress	[2016-02-21 22:37:27] PfSense is pretty great. OpenSense is shaping up nicely too.
2016-02-22 09:21:01	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:38:45] Isn't pfSence open? I know they offer support for $, but I thought there was a community version.
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:47:38] Shit
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:47:38] I did a Tristan
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:48:02] There is
2016-02-22 09:21:01	EricT	[2016-02-21 22:48:12] no power brick ?
2016-02-22 09:21:01	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-21 22:49:39] No I left voice recording going for the last 20 minutes
2016-02-22 09:21:02	Moritz	[00:23:04] It is FOSS with optional commercial support.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	EricT	[00:34:01] good to know....bedtime here....

2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[07:58:21] how is it.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[07:58:30] any why did you scare Stefan off?
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:21:39] No, we were actually talking about open source for once
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:21:49] Maybe he had the wrong video about the group
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:21:55] Idea* not video
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:22:26] hahah. I would say at least 20 percent of discusiion here is software based :P
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:22:52] 20 percent gif
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:22:57] actually
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:23:01] prob 40 percent gif.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:23:45] I'd say less than 10% gif
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:24:08] depends when you're on.
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:24:12] :D
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:27:11] I suppose
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:28:00] BTW the latest episode of BSDnow has a really good interview with a guy who has commit rights on freebsd, dragonfly and netbsd
2016-02-22 09:21:02	PaulGleeson	[08:28:56] It explain the relationship between dragonfly and freebsd very well
2016-02-22 09:21:02	NicholasB	[08:29:23] certainly.

2016-02-22 09:40:44	EricT	How can you have your pudding if you dont eat your meat?
2016-02-22 09:40:44	Joe	What does his ability to extract metal from its ore have to do with your proximity to him?

2016-02-22 09:49:25	@fsociety	layers of fear scared the shit out of me a few times
2016-02-22 09:49:50	@fsociety	layers of fear took me about 4 hours to complete, and firewatch about 5 hours
2016-02-22 09:51:43	EricT	Is @elChupaNibre over his manflu?
2016-02-22 09:52:20	NottheOtherDan	No. It's cranked up a level to full body soreness.

2016-02-22 11:37:05	@fsociety	they're only strippers, they won't care
2016-02-22 11:37:13	@fsociety	it's not like they have any self respect anyways
2016-02-22 11:37:23	@fsociety	they'd probably be high on some amphetamine anyway
2016-02-22 11:37:59	EricT	Meth sweat on my bacon! YUM!

2016-02-22 11:39:59	EricT	You too hardcore, bro!
2016-02-22 11:40:22	NottheOtherDan	Save that RAM!
2016-02-22 11:40:37	EricT	bank it for your retirement!
2016-02-22 11:40:46	EricT	so much ram!
2016-02-22 11:41:39	EricT	McScrooge Duck swimming in dimms!
2016-02-22 11:42:02	@fsociety	im scrooge mcdimm
2016-02-22 11:42:22	EricT	it rubs the dimms on its skin...
2016-02-22 11:42:32	@fsociety	though i'm about to compile ue4 so that should use some ram
2016-02-22 11:43:04	NottheOtherDan	1Gb used - 35Gb free
2016-02-22 11:43:45	@fsociety	actually iv made it so gentoo compiles in tmpfs, so for example compiling firefox can use up to 12gb of ram during compile
2016-02-22 11:43:51	@fsociety	but it speeds it up quite considerably
2016-02-22 11:44:25	NicholasB	I used to run all my firefox and chrome in tmpfs to speed it up
2016-02-22 11:44:32	NicholasB	esp on older laptops
2016-02-22 11:44:52	@fsociety	did those laptops have oodles of ram?
2016-02-22 11:45:07	NicholasB	4 gig in my little netbooks
2016-02-22 11:45:13	NicholasB	enough to make a difference
2016-02-22 11:45:31	NicholasB	also when I had a small ssd in my laptop. and 8 gig of ram I did the same
2016-02-22 11:46:40	@fsociety	ahh. i just use tmpfs during compiling, i really wanted to like palemoon.. but none of the extensions i use are compatible with it
2016-02-22 11:47:49	@fsociety	so now im just alternating between firefox and qutebrowser
2016-02-22 11:48:03	@fsociety	vimb is pretty good but lacks tabs
2016-02-22 11:48:30	@fsociety	i think my biggest thing i need though is vim keyboard shortcuts in my browser, i've gotten so accustomed to it
2016-02-22 11:48:37	Moritz	Fab about why you should leave Windows. (There are 5000 Locky infections per hour in Germany).

2016-02-22 11:48:57	@fsociety	Why you should leave Germany = Fab
2016-02-22 11:49:46	NicholasB	i love how you can almost understand german if you speak English.
2016-02-22 11:50:17	NicholasB	not always. but some sentences are like.
2016-02-22 11:50:25	NicholasB	I KNOW WHAT THOSE WORDS ARE TRYING TO BE!
2016-02-22 11:50:48	@fsociety	i would love to watch a german spelling bee
2016-02-22 11:51:14	NicholasB	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq07U0HLuM8
2016-02-22 11:52:33	@fsociety	wish i could watch that right now
2016-02-22 11:52:33		[11:52]
2016-02-22 11:52:45	NicholasB	its not that impressive.
2016-02-22 11:52:48	NicholasB	he's a English kid
2016-02-22 11:52:56	NicholasB	so its his second language and seem pretty simple.
2016-02-22 11:53:13	@fsociety	i want moss from it crowd to do it
2016-02-22 11:53:13	NicholasB	so that's awesome but its not like some genius german kids spelling 29 letter long words.

2016-02-23 01:39:49	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 18:05:21] Non Aussie here
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:06:13] Im Ausie, shit yeh!
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:06:18] lol
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:24] hello.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:32] actually we have more overseas listeners.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:33] oddly.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:06:45] 55/45 split
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:00] unless of course our listeneres are using vpns
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:06] in foreign countries
2016-02-23 01:39:49	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:07:23] Strangely specific.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:31] i read stats.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:54] now lachlan. i present the following tale of caution to all new users of this group
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:55] turn
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:07:59] off notifications
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:08:14] what's the standard deviation?
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:08:17] you'll be a nnoyed and your phone will die.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:08:26] BDSM i believe.
2016-02-23 01:39:49	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:08:37] Im a non-standard deviate
2016-02-23 01:39:49	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:09:53] Lol OK. I thought I'd sign up to this and a few other channels for tech security announcements. What's the growth rate in listeners from pod release to pod release?
2016-02-23 01:39:49	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:11:09] its stalled alittle through xmas. but thats too be expected. but its slowly rising.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:11:33] <br><img id="3">
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:11:41] Lol
2016-02-23 01:39:51	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:11:51] This is not a classic&quot;announcements&quot; kind of channel, more warbly banter
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:12:15] Cool cool.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:12:16] yeah. more like irc but not using legacy technology
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:15:38] I tried to do the whole irc thing but I just couldn't be bothered with the setup with nick servers and stuff.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:16:17] yeah. i find it feel like a chore to have it running. esp on my phone. plus all my non podcast buddies are on it now.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	TristanJames	[2016-02-22 18:16:21] I haven't seen anyone use a/s/l on here either.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:16:22] nice and centralised
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:16:51] thats because i know you're in ballarat, i know you're up for it and i know you're legal.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	EricT	[2016-02-22 18:18:27] can I hook up tinder to telegram?
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:18:41] in linux? no.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:18:41] My  friends use a combo of hangouts and signal for EFF style private chats.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:19:05] i never understood the attraction of signal because it still eaves metadata
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:19:14] for messages anyway.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	TristanJames	[2016-02-22 18:19:16] Snap.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:27:43] What metadata do you speak of? Signal is just like telegram it seems. If you have two users on signal then by default signal encrypts it. If not it reverts to txt messages. The encrypted message on signal is not sent over a txt message it's a data message rather then a txt. I provide it by 'signalling' someone with out my sim in my phone and they got the message.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:28:34] OK. Then that's my bad. I could have sworn it encrypted text messages like text secure.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:29:47] Text secure and signal are the same thing. Text secure was rebranded to signal. They didn't change the methodology of encrypted messages when they rebranded. ð
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:30:09] Ahhhhhh. Well there you go.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:30:42] I still thought it was just encrypted on the phone though.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:30:49] But now I know.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:31:28] The only meta data you could claim the signal sends is ip traffic to a server probably outside of Australia. But telegram would be the same problem as well. ð
2016-02-23 01:39:51	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 18:31:34] NP mate.
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:32:41] Yeah exactly. I think where my confusion was is that when I installed it like 4 years ago it fell back to sms
2016-02-23 01:39:51	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:32:55] I assumed it was just encrypting the SMS.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:43:56] <br><img id="4">
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:44:30] They clean the tube trains at night so someone drunk that this morning
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:44:44] It's not even 8am
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:46:55] They could have been a night shift worker.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:47:09] Having one on the way home.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:50:01] True
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 18:50:01] Do you have spesh there?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:50:41] Spesh?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:50:57] Oh that's the beer
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:51:07] Nah not that I can tell from the can.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:51:19] We have the green calsberg cans.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:51:33] But no one really drinks it.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 18:52:26] I like how all anti graffiti chairs are blue with red green and red markings though. World wide.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	Joe	[2016-02-22 19:07:10] Spesh is 9%
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:08:59] Ahh. Yeah we don't get strong beers in aus as a general rule. It might be a legal thing re: amount of tax.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:10:14] well im frying up some giblets and hearts!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:11:58] Ewww
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:12:06] For the dog I hope.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:13:01] Chilli n lemon, fuck the dogs!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:14:53] *shudder*
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:16:07] Mediterean thing...
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 19:17:34] Indeed. I mean I know they are in my sausages but they're camoflauged.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 19:18:28] I celebrate all the innerds!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NotDan	[2016-02-22 20:35:29] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0SU7hF8xLY
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:14:52] So I was considering getting a Vid card upgrade to a GTX970
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:14:59] or 980 but
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:38] but what.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:39] DOOO IT
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:16:42] I may wait, Nvidia is due to release new Pascal Vid cards in April, so might have to put in my old GTX580 to replace one of my blown 770 and limp till available, the new GPUs look amazeballs!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:51] ohhh
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:16:54] yeah. fair enough
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:17:15] performance on Pascal looks SUPER!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:17:30] Quantum leap even!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:17:36] Poor @F_s0c1ety
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:17:45] would that be turbo pascal?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:17:48] http://wccftech.com/nvidia-gp100-pascal-zauba/
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:17:48] I'll stick with amd
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:18:01] you mad?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:18:04] lol
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:18:24] No just not running any Linux boxes any more
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:18:28] There all bsd
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:18:36] Voodoo or GTFO
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:19:14] nice name too, GTX1080!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:20:23] I tried BSD, but wine+Nvidia killed my enthusiam...
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:20:25] alas
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:20:39] I'm on dragonfly
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:20:55] The only os with full skylake support
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:21:09] Your telling me this isn't bleeding?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:21:22] skylake's gpu
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:21:33] if i ever run a server I'll go for it. But as a everyday user I can
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:21:39] can't see any benefit
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:21:40] Point stands :P
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:21:52] ditto @F_s0c1ety
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:22:07] I recently got a 970, then oculus announced the minimum for the retail unit. And my mate was egging me to get it cause his VR crazy... But I was like meh, CBF to vr. He was really jelly. Angry jelly :O
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:22:33] im annoyed go i have the 960.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:22:39] Cardboard or GTFO
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:22:43] ill still be getting it.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:23:16] WOW I started a flurry of activity!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:23:23] Steam support for HTC?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:23:39] I should do some research on that thing.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:23:40] Telegram is my soundboard for ideas...lol
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:23:43] yup. and steammachine too. so linux in effect
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:23:59] I thought you said furry
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:24:24] furries with tentacles or GTFO!
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:25:50] anyone want to buy my corsair k70-rgb
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:25:59] im offloading it. too much incompaitiblity
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:26:04] I want a steam controller and steam link so fucking bad it hurts!!! I reckon it's all because valve are valve time plus boycotting AUS from the l4d2 gore mode review rating thingo.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:26:18] Why @enjayembee ?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:26:42] Steam controller is great, when it  doesn't lock my cpu
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:04] its not working properly. freezes boot, i cahnge the polling  and it will work, but the colours wont. i cahnge it to another poll rate and the keyboard just repeats the same keypress.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:13] seems to be after a kernel update.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:27] a keyboard shouldnt be a source of consternation.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:27:31] is it a dual usb?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:27:35] yeah
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:28:22] you are using both ports?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:28:28] yup
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:28:28] I've even thought about a mail forwarder from the USA to get it. Although it seems some aussie valve loving YouTubers have gotten some hardware.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:28:46] got any us buddies?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-22 22:29:13] Yes I got friends but they won't forward it for me lol
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NotDan	[2016-02-22 22:29:21] I have many US buddies
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:29:22] I had issues with my Ducky at start but that was because of USB KVM, Thje linux doesnt like Emulated Kboard
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:31:46] i'll have some more reading in to it. but i've pretty much done with it. i'll loose like 80 bucks out of the deal but i had it for 8 months .
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:31:48] ehh happens
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:31:55] repalce KVM with a totally non-emulated one and all is good
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:32:30] but it will need the emulation to run the custome software no?
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:40:54] it needs emulation for the shortcut keys, but that is only if behind an &quot;intelligent&quot; kvm
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:41:29] hmm. i'll look in to it tomorrow. but if i fail dismally then to the bay of e it goes.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:42:12] to be honest my hundred buck generic cherry mech keybaord is more satisfying to type on.
2016-02-23 01:40:06	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:42:18] hid device or go home
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:42:25] I still have to plug in my ducky and logitech k700 into a win box to program them, but once done they retain settings in flash
2016-02-23 01:40:06	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:42:53] yeah the corsair remeber one setting but wont cycle with out the software. nor will they animate. just light up
2016-02-23 01:40:06	EricT	[2016-02-22 22:43:00] I have 2 classic Cherry blacks with touchpads on them,lol

2016-02-23 01:40:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:43:43] 80 because of postage
2016-02-23 01:40:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-22 22:43:50] 30 on there own
2016-02-23 01:40:08	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:45:42] well i like em.
2016-02-23 01:40:08	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:45:57] ill prob go down the simple back lit route and just get some nice custom caps

2016-02-23 01:40:08	NicholasB	[2016-02-22 22:54:37] put the xp wallper on your bsd machine and stare at the blue.

2016-02-23 05:27:45	Moritz	How many german listeners?
2016-02-23 05:34:23	@fsociety	none at all :)
2016-02-23 05:38:44	Moritz	If it is just one, try to get my pi on port 2222 ð
2016-02-23 05:42:15	Moritz	BTW: do you need to truncate ip addresses in logs? By EU privacy law you can't save whole IP addresses in e.g. your apache access_log. That's why it is a pain to setup Google Analytics lawfully. If you use the FOSS analytics software PIWIK you can just press a button to conform with EU privacy law. So handy. FOSS FTW

2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[07:15:07] @lightonfluxÂ I don't see the IPs directly. Libsyn just gives me geographic locations. The last episode had 5 percent of our downloads (round about) from Germany.
2016-02-23 08:50:43	PaulGleeson	[08:06:38] Do ye have 20 downloads
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:07:56] some episode 21 downloads.
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:08:00] that's good isn't it
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:08:13] that's like world famous level right?
2016-02-23 08:50:43	PaulGleeson	[08:09:04] Its cool thought and ye continue to improve
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:09:56] we might get 30 dls per episode by the years end.
2016-02-23 08:50:43	NicholasB	[08:10:16] I just got to work an hour ago but it feels like a lifetime.

2016-02-23 10:11:43	MartinWimpress	[10:09:46] <br><img id="4">
2016-02-23 10:11:43	MartinWimpress	[10:09:59] Yes, that's a top menu.
2016-02-23 10:11:43	MartinWimpress	[10:10:05] Yes, that Ubuntu MATE.
2016-02-23 10:13:57	@fsociety	i want Ubuntu BSPWM
2016-02-23 10:13:58	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-23 10:14:04	@fsociety	or Ubuntu WMUTILS
2016-02-23 10:20:00		[10:14]
2016-02-23 10:20:10	NicholasB	wait. so mate is being styled on unity now?
2016-02-23 10:20:32	NicholasB	is there a MUNITY coming?
2016-02-23 10:20:54	LachlanHolmes	i'd say it's one of the many presets that martin likes to include in the settings
2016-02-23 10:21:17	LachlanHolmes	like redmond and cupertino
2016-02-23 10:22:01	NicholasB	im not sure if i mentioned it on a show but i had a far too accurate xp theme on cinnamon one day
2016-02-23 10:22:03	NicholasB	it was scary
2016-02-23 10:23:31	LachlanHolmes	<br><img id="5">
2016-02-23 10:23:31	LachlanHolmes	i just did a google image search for xenial xerus and found this image and thought, it was win 10 for a second :P
2016-02-23 10:24:18	LachlanHolmes	but the start menu is not exactly a cc of win 10 but it's scary close.
2016-02-23 10:24:40	NicholasB	i haven't used 10 yet.
2016-02-23 10:29:33	MartinWimpress	Mutiny is a new panel layout.
2016-02-23 10:29:33	LachlanHolmes	got it at work and here...  only recently got a dual boot setup (2x ssds) for my gaming pc. Otherwise i use antergos for a systen76 lappy and ubuntu mate on my older Lenovo ( actually running the 16.04 alpha) :)
2016-02-23 10:29:54	MartinWimpress	@dibZr Speaks the truth, it is activated via MATE Tweak.
2016-02-23 10:30:10	MartinWimpress	But that top menu can be freely used in any panel.
2016-02-23 10:30:23	MartinWimpress	Imagine that customisation ð
2016-02-23 10:30:55	MartinWimpress	And the dock, you can plonk it where you like ð®
2016-02-23 10:31:24	EricT	Sorry at work, @wimpress downloaded alpha 2 from the buntus last night...
2016-02-23 10:32:25	LachlanHolmes	@wimpress question for you, if you don't mind. Have you decided on a default launcher ( like gnome do or synapse or something) or really haven't found a good enough one for the task?
2016-02-23 10:38:00		[10:32]
2016-02-23 10:44:02	MartinWimpress	@dibZr Awkward.
2016-02-23 10:44:27	MartinWimpress	I favoured Synapse until it started segfaulting it pants in November last year ð
2016-02-23 10:44:45	MartinWimpress	So I've built a PPA for Albert. I like it, but it is not quite ready ready.
2016-02-23 10:45:08	MartinWimpress	https://launchpad.net/~flexiondotorg/+archive/ubuntu/albert
2016-02-23 10:45:15	MartinWimpress	But ALbert is shaping up nicely.
2016-02-23 10:45:21	LachlanHolmes	LOOOL for a split second there i thought 'Awkward' was a new launcher i didn't know about :P
2016-02-23 10:45:36	MartinWimpress	GNOME Do looks nice, but doesn't integrate with MATE.
2016-02-23 10:45:44	MartinWimpress	Then there is Kupfer.
2016-02-23 10:45:51	MartinWimpress	Which is dead upstream.
2016-02-23 10:46:15	MartinWimpress	Most likely we will fork Kupfer and modernise it.
2016-02-23 10:46:25	MartinWimpress	But that will not happen into for 16.04 ð
2016-02-23 10:46:27	LachlanHolmes	ok cool cool, so don't expect a laucher for 16.04...
2016-02-23 10:46:40	LachlanHolmes	thats fine thanks for answering
2016-02-23 10:46:44	MartinWimpress	But we will back port it for 16.04 during the 16.10 development cycle.
2016-02-23 10:47:10	MartinWimpress	If Synapse get fixed, I spoke with th dev earlier today, it is a shoe in.
2016-02-23 10:47:22	MartinWimpress	Failing that, we will do something else in 16.10.
2016-02-23 10:47:54	MartinWimpress	Back story, I added MATE compatibility to everywhere it is need to Synapse.
2016-02-23 10:48:03	MartinWimpress	So if it works, it fully integrates.
2016-02-23 10:50:09	LachlanHolmes	:) yeah im currntly using synapse with a config edit to make it work with the super key. for some werid reason in the config gui when you go to set the super key as the hotkey it doesn't detect it. ð
2016-02-23 10:50:21	LachlanHolmes	anyway thanks for the info.
2016-02-23 10:52:35	@fsociety	systemau website on a minimal browser :)
2016-02-23 10:52:35	@fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/A5FjE.png
2016-02-23 10:53:44	NicholasB	i like that you need to read a how too on taking a screen shot.
2016-02-23 10:53:44		[10:53]
2016-02-23 10:53:45	NicholasB	;)
2016-02-23 10:56:59	@fsociety	it was more so on how to take a screenshot of a window
2016-02-23 10:57:08	@fsociety	i never do that usually
2016-02-23 10:57:13	@fsociety	i didn't realise gimp had that functionality
2016-02-23 10:57:52	LachlanHolmes	what's the browser?
2016-02-23 10:58:03	@fsociety	qutebrowser
2016-02-23 10:58:16	@fsociety	a browser designed if you love vim :)
2016-02-23 10:58:25	@fsociety	well you don't have to use it like vim, but it is recommended
2016-02-23 10:58:47	NicholasB	ive been looking at custom key caps. saw a vim set and thought of you.

2016-02-23 20:03:33	LachlanHolmes	[12:59:30] i'm sure there would be a exponential scale that logs time spent over number of diffenent fillings....
2016-02-23 20:03:33	LachlanHolmes	[13:00:20] yeah my work is strange.. i work 12 hour shifts. day or night. so i get huge chunks of nothing to do time.

2016-02-25 12:00:11	TristanJames	I thought it was the weekend when I woke up this morning. I think it's because I went to the Melbourne Victory game last night and didn't get home til 12.30. The bloody bus detoured via Footscray and Ballan on the way back to Ballarat.
2016-02-25 12:02:21	TristanJames	Anyone in need of some puppy love? http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/02/uber-is-delivering-puppies-to-australian-cities-today/

2016-02-25 13:40:50	NicholasB	smart cat.
2016-02-25 13:42:08	CarlosLopez	It took me so long to join because there was no room on my phone (I finally downloaded the linux x64 binary)
2016-02-25 13:42:27	NicholasB	well standard housekeeping. turn off notifications. it will drain your phone and irritate you :)
2016-02-25 13:42:32	NicholasB	ohh no room on your phone!

2016-02-25 13:42:36	CarlosLopez	nope
2016-02-25 13:42:56	CarlosLopez	it's an old Motorola XT320

2016-02-25 13:45:40	NicholasB	this channel contain much talk of food. weather. tech and sticker posting.
2016-02-25 13:47:15	CarlosLopez	warning: got a bad ADSL line, so I might go offline at times - Telstra &quot;guarantee&quot; tha an engineer will come and look at the line &quot;within the next 10 working days&quot;.  Prepare to hear whining from me.
2016-02-25 13:47:58	NicholasB	all good. there is a bit of whining in here as well
2016-02-25 13:49:02	CarlosLopez	So is this busier than the freenode channel? Are we it for the moment?
2016-02-25 13:49:26	NicholasB	oh dude. this is a vertiable smorgasboard of conversation compritivley
2016-02-25 13:49:39	CarlosLopez	noice
2016-02-25 13:49:42	NicholasB	some days i wake up and there are like 300 missed messages
2016-02-25 13:50:10	JustinZobel	I rejoined after about a month and it was in the order of about 5,000
2016-02-25 13:50:11	NicholasB	we've got some brit in here who keep it going.
2016-02-25 13:50:16	NicholasB	hahahaha
2016-02-25 13:50:19	CarlosLopez	youch!
2016-02-25 13:50:33	NicholasB	yeah. thus the notification turn off.
2016-02-25 13:51:16	CarlosLopez	Well, it's my first time with the desktop client (first time with telegram at all) so I'll see what it does
2016-02-25 13:51:51	NicholasB	sweet. if we're really lucky
2016-02-25 13:52:02	CarlosLopez	myes?
2016-02-25 13:52:02	NicholasB	@wimpress will give us secret mate updates
2016-02-25 13:52:17	CarlosLopez	like how mate now comes with unity?
2016-02-25 13:52:29	NicholasB	that was annouced her 30 mins before anywhere else!
2016-02-25 13:52:35	CarlosLopez	lol - nice
2016-02-25 13:56:19	LachlanHolmes	Yeah I loved the mutiny update from @wimpress. Should rename the channel to &quot;Australian Ubuntu mate&quot; user group.
2016-02-25 13:56:35	NicholasB	Aussie Mate(s)
2016-02-25 13:57:19	LachlanHolmes	Lol yeah I'm trying to think of something witty with mate Australia and Ubuntu. Coming up stumps, here.
2016-02-25 13:57:36	CarlosLopez	[speaks as an aside to the audience] hell, I'm thinking of trying i3!
2016-02-25 13:57:56	NicholasB	ha. tiling window managers are a hot toipic in here
2016-02-25 13:58:03	CarlosLopez	hehehe
2016-02-25 13:58:42	CarlosLopez	all right lads - I'm off to have my reheated curry from last night. Catch you in a bit.
2016-02-25 13:58:47	LachlanHolmes	#aum - artist formerly known as #systemau.
2016-02-25 13:59:03	NicholasB	catch ya. great to see you here!
2016-02-25 13:59:09	CarlosLopez	ð
2016-02-25 13:59:20	NicholasB	<br><img id="3">
2016-02-25 14:01:18	LachlanHolmes	So what's you linux of choice @enjayembee ?
2016-02-25 14:01:57	NicholasB	um normally ubuntu mate or mint cinnamon.
2016-02-25 14:02:04	NicholasB	i was a huge crunch bang fan.
2016-02-25 14:02:19	NicholasB	but i can't seem to get in to as much these days
2016-02-25 14:02:21	NicholasB	you?
2016-02-25 14:07:01	LachlanHolmes	Historically Ubuntu. But I use Ubuntu, Ubuntu mate and antergos. For vm's for servers it's either Ubuntu server or freebsd.
2016-02-25 14:08:22	NicholasB	i have a fan pc server box thing sitting here i really should set it up.
2016-02-25 14:08:31	NicholasB	i still can justify a server just for me though.
2016-02-25 14:08:34	NicholasB	*can't
2016-02-25 14:08:45	NicholasB	i live alone and have a desktop and alaptop.
2016-02-25 14:08:47	NicholasB	seems overkill
2016-02-25 14:09:53	LachlanHolmes	Typical freebsd for packages that are super simple to setup. Ubuntu server for anything else that requires more current release of software or I I can use a easy to understand setup guide. Cause I'm basically shit at Linux if I can't find a how-to or find a solution via Google-fu.
2016-02-25 14:10:14	LachlanHolmes	I have 1 server and 2 nas's at home.
2016-02-25 14:10:25	NicholasB	you have a fwe people connected to it or just you?
2016-02-25 14:10:57	LachlanHolmes	Me and GF really.
2016-02-25 14:13:16	LachlanHolmes	Put I justify the setup and cost of it all cause I work in IT and the company's i've worked never want to spend on you to learn tech. So I have to be self taught. ð
2016-02-25 14:13:32	LachlanHolmes	But I justify***
2016-02-25 14:16:20	NicholasB	fair enough.
2016-02-25 14:16:24	NicholasB	right out for a bit.
2016-02-25 14:16:30	NicholasB	catch.
2016-02-25 14:20:37	LewisCividin	Hey how you all doing today?
2016-02-25 14:21:04	Sean	Have you tried Emby for a media server. I've been nessibg around with that for a bit and I like it.
2016-02-25 14:21:16	Sean	*messing
2016-02-25 14:21:31	Sean	Hey Lewis
2016-02-25 14:41:30	@fsociety	how big is nas LachlanHolmes?
2016-02-25 14:41:40	@fsociety	big is the nas*
2016-02-25 14:47:02	EricT	NAS envy?
2016-02-25 14:53:37	LachlanHolmes	1 is 8tb and the other is 12tb.
2016-02-25 14:59:39	LachlanHolmes	Both are running freenas.
2016-02-25 15:01:33	@fsociety	ahh nice, i've been running just one using openmediavault and it sits at 42tb
2016-02-25 15:01:59	@fsociety	though i built the nas in mind using a micro-atx mobo and small case
2016-02-25 15:02:34	@fsociety	on saying that openmediavault's new release comes out very soon. time to do that dreaded upgrade soon enough
2016-02-25 15:05:18	LachlanHolmes	Yeah I tried open once, I should revisit it but freenas has always done what I've needed.
2016-02-25 15:07:36	AzzaMatazz	I use openmediavault, only on a odroid as my nas. It runs great!
2016-02-25 15:08:06	LachlanHolmes	My capacity is small but the 8tb nas is raidz2 with 6x2tb drives and the other one is the freenas mini. Which has about 20ish jails running on itð so it's basically another vm host really like my esxi box.
2016-02-25 15:09:01	LachlanHolmes	Yeah alot of people like openmediavault. Makes me want to look at what vm's you can get for it now.
2016-02-25 15:09:21	AzzaMatazz	What sort of hardware are you using? Zfs?
2016-02-25 15:10:52	LachlanHolmes	1 freenas mini with 4x4tb WD reds as raidz1 and well the other one is listed above.
2016-02-25 15:11:23	LachlanHolmes	The 8tb was built 6years ago too :p
2016-02-25 15:12:54	AzzaMatazz	Ah nice, wow that's going strong! i should get some proper hardware. I ran nas4free for a while, but drunk deleted a NFS mount before it was unmounted and found out BSD is really good at deletion ð
2016-02-25 15:15:49	LachlanHolmes	Yeah build a nas is fun but to me the most important part is getting the right mobo.
2016-02-25 15:17:46	LachlanHolmes	Cause finding a hba that's actually a hba is annoying and to me if your hba dies you might not be able to get a replacement... But that was a while ago I haven't really looked to much. I just try and find a mobo that has a butt ton of sata ports.
2016-02-25 15:20:43	LachlanHolmes	This link is the modern equivalent of my nas now a days. https://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=21683&amp;cPath=547
2016-02-25 15:23:30	AzzaMatazz	My main want is something quiet. Building one is on my todo list, I wouldn't know where to start with hardware choice though. But would like to give  BSD another go, the jails looked really good, and I want to set up some zfs storage to play with.
2016-02-25 15:25:30	AzzaMatazz	Oo that's a nice case!
2016-02-25 15:30:27	LachlanHolmes	Yeah so I got 6 2tb drives in there and then a old shitty 80gb HDD for the base OS of freenas and it's been running strong for 6 years.
2016-02-25 15:37:16	@fsociety	for my NAS I actually use mhhdfs which is a way to pool all drives and make it one using whatever file systems you wish.  no need for raid or such.  great software solution though.
2016-02-25 15:37:33	@fsociety	so it seems the Linux Mint website has been compromised since mid Jan
2016-02-25 15:37:34	@fsociety	ouch
2016-02-25 15:38:20	@fsociety	just gets worse and worse
2016-02-25 15:38:48	CarlosLopez	ouch indeed! I wonder whether anyone's testing compromised ISOs to see what's been affected
2016-02-25 15:39:50	@fsociety	well looking at the isos the hacker was real amateurish to the point his script didn't work properly
2016-02-25 15:40:02	CarlosLopez	lol
2016-02-25 15:40:09	@fsociety	he put the execution of his script after an exit 0 in the rc.conf file
2016-02-25 15:40:10	CarlosLopez	script kiddies
2016-02-25 15:40:45	@fsociety	essentially mint got pawned by a script kiddie
2016-02-25 15:40:54	TristanJames	Dick Smith Electronics to close all their stores. Everythings still massively overpriced.
2016-02-25 15:40:57	CarlosLopez	not a good look
2016-02-25 15:41:08	@fsociety	dick smith aren't closing . spoke to a staff member the other day
2016-02-25 15:41:23	LachlanHolmes	I'll look into that. ð
2016-02-25 15:41:27	TristanJames	http://www.theage.com.au/business/retail/dick-smith-to-close-all-stores-3000-staff-to-go-20160225-gn3ios.html
2016-02-25 15:42:05	@fsociety	ahh the staff member said about the expression of interest
2016-02-25 15:42:06	LachlanHolmes	Isn't that just the regular result of receivership?
2016-02-25 15:42:55	@fsociety	oh well, poor staff member.
2016-02-25 15:43:09	@fsociety	all i buy from dse these days is well.... nothing
2016-02-25 15:43:10	@fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-25 15:43:29	@fsociety	actually i bought a 5.1 samsung unit eons ago that literally died 3 months after purchase
2016-02-25 15:43:30	AzzaMatazz	Yeah after a quick search that looks like something to read up on. Is it like LVM?
2016-02-25 15:44:32	@fsociety	what mhhdfs does is you chain the all drives in your fstab, and it will use the drives with the most free space and then move to thext one, but all coming under the one mount
2016-02-25 15:44:50	@fsociety	the advantage of this, if you want to check the drive seperately and mount it you can
2016-02-25 15:44:50	LachlanHolmes	So it's a jbod?
2016-02-25 15:45:06	TristanJames	Exactly. I've gone in a couple of times in the last couple of months expecting half decent prices on things but everything I wanted was full price.
2016-02-25 15:45:29	@fsociety	exaclty Lachlan
2016-02-25 15:46:04	@fsociety	Probably the bank trying to get as much money back as possible
2016-02-25 15:46:16	@fsociety	Same thing happened with Allans Music for a while, but right at the last minute they got bought up
2016-02-25 15:47:06	@fsociety	romanrm.net/mhddfs
2016-02-25 15:47:41	LachlanHolmes	Hmmm OK not the best for a nas in my opinion but it would be awesome for large fast temp storage before final commit to a more resilient storage device.
2016-02-25 15:47:53	AzzaMatazz	Ha, just reading that now!
2016-02-25 15:48:13	@fsociety	ive never had an issue with it tbh, not one failure in the past 3 years
2016-02-25 15:48:14	LachlanHolmes	Like 4 m.2 sata drives as a jbod would be hectic!
2016-02-25 15:48:31	@fsociety	i have 8 drives
2016-02-25 15:48:37	@fsociety	mostly 4tb and two 6tbs
2016-02-25 15:49:16	NicholasB	i always checked the bargain bin. same with hardley normal. there normal shit is stupidly priced but sometimes they clearance some good stuff.
2016-02-25 15:49:23	LachlanHolmes	But if a disk dies all your data is toast right or just the data on that drive that you have no means of tracking it onto the disk as there is a layer of abstraction?
2016-02-25 15:49:30	@fsociety	just the data on that drive
2016-02-25 15:49:58	@fsociety	and tbh all my "important" data is backed up in several places.. nas is mainly my own netflix which is larger than netflix. haha
2016-02-25 15:50:11	@fsociety	and being on 100mbit unlimited internet losing data isn't really so much an issue
2016-02-25 15:51:00	@fsociety	i see what you are saying though, i've just never been a fan of RAID
2016-02-25 15:51:39	NicholasB	i've never carded that much about my data. there is very little that i would cry over if i lost.
2016-02-25 15:51:46	LachlanHolmes	Please correct me if I'm wrong but it sounds exactly like raid 0
2016-02-25 15:51:48	NicholasB	maybe a few photos but ehhh.
2016-02-25 15:52:12	@fsociety	but more versatile
2016-02-25 15:52:48	LachlanHolmes	I only have about 200 GB of data I care about and that's just solely photos that are of family stuff. Everything else is expendable.
2016-02-25 15:53:09	@fsociety	i'm not particarly attached to anything either on it.. its more of a service to my family and friends who are scared of downloading anything
2016-02-25 15:53:20	@fsociety	every few months - dean heres another 2tb drive.. fill er up
2016-02-25 15:53:43	LachlanHolmes	Cool cool
2016-02-25 15:53:56	@fsociety	and i like to hoard
2016-02-25 15:54:08	LachlanHolmes	Torrents, private torrents or usenet?
2016-02-25 15:54:16	@fsociety	especially with programs like sonarr, couchpotato, etc
2016-02-25 15:54:20	@fsociety	usenet
2016-02-25 15:54:24	@fsociety	occasionally torrents
2016-02-25 15:54:26	LachlanHolmes	OK usenet
2016-02-25 15:54:52	@fsociety	torrents are run in a docker container that has OpenVPN inside it, so only VPN traffic is routed through that container
2016-02-25 15:54:54	LachlanHolmes	Whose your provider?
2016-02-25 15:55:05	@fsociety	i was with astra for years, then newshosting and now supernews
2016-02-25 15:55:12	LachlanHolmes	Ah ok
2016-02-25 15:55:12	@fsociety	newshosting was the best for retention, but they're expensive
2016-02-25 15:55:32	NicholasB	im with astra now. but i use it so infrequently it doesn bear mnentionign.
2016-02-25 15:55:40	NicholasB	i just pay for block 25 gig.
2016-02-25 15:55:48	NicholasB	last me 6 months
2016-02-25 15:55:58	@fsociety	once upon a time internode gave you astraweb for free
2016-02-25 15:56:09	NicholasB	oh was that astraweb
2016-02-25 15:56:13	@fsociety	yeah it was
2016-02-25 15:56:15	NicholasB	i remember getting free newsgroups
2016-02-25 15:56:20	NicholasB	didnt know it was astra
2016-02-25 15:56:45	@fsociety	the unfortunate thing if i remember correctly is they didn't offer ssl over newsgroups
2016-02-25 15:56:50	LachlanHolmes	Yeah I used internode's free usenet service for a long time but then got scared of them not offering a SSL version so I went with tweaknews.NL for a while.
2016-02-25 15:56:52	@fsociety	so thats a little insecure, but thats about it
2016-02-25 15:57:32	@fsociety	its like i used sabnzbd for years, then i discovered nzbget..
2016-02-25 15:57:42	@fsociety	that was the last big change in usenet for me.. haha
2016-02-25 15:57:44	NicholasB	as i have the vpn on ive never really been fussed about the ssl factor.
2016-02-25 15:57:54	NicholasB	i enable it but it doesnt bother me.
2016-02-25 15:57:59	@fsociety	dont route vpn through usenet.. shudder
2016-02-25 15:58:16	NicholasB	why?
2016-02-25 15:58:28	NicholasB	my routers runs the vpn. all goes through it
2016-02-25 15:58:31	@fsociety	pointless, enable ssl and be done with it and use all bandwidth possible
2016-02-25 15:58:45	NicholasB	ohh i dont care about bandwith. i mean i download little
2016-02-25 15:58:46	@fsociety	yeah im finicky where my vpn routes.. thats why i set up containers
2016-02-25 15:58:52	NicholasB	i still get 30mbs down
2016-02-25 15:58:54	@fsociety	also steam will ban you if use a vpn consistantly
2016-02-25 15:59:05	NicholasB	ahh when i download on steam i turn it off
2016-02-25 15:59:07	NicholasB	but thats it
2016-02-25 15:59:25	NicholasB	oh and time sensitive hangouts or mumble ill turn it off
2016-02-25 15:59:29	@fsociety	yeah i dont want to steam to ban me... i'd lose 336 games
2016-02-25 15:59:48	NicholasB	when you say ban you why?
2016-02-25 15:59:57	NicholasB	i use a vpn all the time but i dont play networked games
2016-02-25 16:00:03	@fsociety	price fixing
2016-02-25 16:00:15	NicholasB	ohhh ok. well my vpn routes out of melbourne
2016-02-25 16:00:18	NicholasB	so ehh
2016-02-25 16:00:30	@fsociety	so you vpn connect to an au server?
2016-02-25 16:00:37	NicholasB	yup.
2016-02-25 16:00:44	@fsociety	interesting, any reason why
2016-02-25 16:00:56	NicholasB	so i can torrent and do shit and not think about it
2016-02-25 16:01:02	NicholasB	like i said i get 30mb speed
2016-02-25 16:01:12	LachlanHolmes	Yeah so my sab was setup with openvpn client to tunnel to I think Lithuania and then ensured the was firewall rules on the jail to only get onto the internet via said VPN link. If it tried to get out via my AUS wan ip it would be blocked on the jail and the router.
2016-02-25 16:01:14	NicholasB	more than adequate for everything.
2016-02-25 16:01:52	NicholasB	and when i do online shoipping or searches i get local response
2016-02-25 16:02:01	@fsociety	i just thought vpning using an au node was kinda pointless
2016-02-25 16:02:06	@fsociety	especially if you want to watch US content
2016-02-25 16:02:07	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-25 16:02:21	NicholasB	its not pointless from the metadata retention point of view
2016-02-25 16:02:30	NicholasB	VPN service providers arent calssified as ISPs
2016-02-25 16:02:53	@fsociety	but thats not stopping the government down the track changing those laws in the future..
2016-02-25 16:03:02	@fsociety	foresight into how they can manipulate everyone as they see fit
2016-02-25 16:03:10	NicholasB	well if they change the laws in the future ill change it
2016-02-25 16:03:22	@fsociety	haha im just a paranoid fuck, because i used to be in the pirate scene
2016-02-25 16:03:30	@fsociety	i'd have to mandatory blowfish encrypt every irc chat
2016-02-25 16:04:11	LachlanHolmes	It was also on a SSL session to the tweaknews server. But I've given up on downloading now. I got scared out if it cause of the Dallas shit. Even though they were going for bit torrent I'm a internode customer and felt my activity's would be next on the chopping block as iinet was the whipping boy of the multinationals... If you what I mean.
2016-02-25 16:04:38	NicholasB	ha.
2016-02-25 16:05:42	NicholasB	thus my vpn on everything. I
2016-02-25 16:06:03	NicholasB	i pirate very little but the little i do i like to not think about it
2016-02-25 16:06:17	LachlanHolmes	So yeah I only downloaded like two TV shows a week but id rather just not bother with it anymore.
2016-02-25 16:06:22	@fsociety	i only pirate movies and tv shows
2016-02-25 16:06:44	LachlanHolmes	Movies are the one thing that's going to get you caught first IMO.
2016-02-25 16:06:50	@fsociety	i tried to go the itunes route but nooo... they don't accept debit card acting as a credit card
2016-02-25 16:07:15	@fsociety	and also its itunes
2016-02-25 16:07:17	NicholasB	i think it depends on the movies. i tend to download older movies. obscure movies.
2016-02-25 16:07:21	@fsociety	same
2016-02-25 16:07:32	@fsociety	i've been searching for a physical copy of Samurai Cop forever
2016-02-25 16:07:46	@fsociety	i want the directors commentary
2016-02-25 16:08:17	NicholasB	http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Samurai-Cop-Special-Edition-Remastered-Deluxe-Edition-Region-4-New-/371520720206?hash=item56805c4d4e:g:tQMAAOSwZ1lWg8Pv
2016-02-25 16:08:19	NicholasB	not looking hard
2016-02-25 16:08:28	@fsociety	i meant when i was out at jb or something
2016-02-25 16:08:57	NicholasB	ebay not good enough for you boy
2016-02-25 16:09:06	@fsociety	i'd buy a digital copy of it i could find it
2016-02-25 16:09:13	@fsociety	i also hate physical items
2016-02-25 16:09:31	@fsociety	why i could never be a hipster
2016-02-25 16:09:48	NicholasB	ha. were polar opposites.
2016-02-25 16:10:08	@fsociety	you just figured that out
2016-02-25 16:10:10	NicholasB	i love having records. not so much dvd or cds because they are just digital anyway
2016-02-25 16:10:15	NicholasB	no i didnt
2016-02-25 16:10:18	@fsociety	im a progressive metal head, and you hate it
2016-02-25 16:10:21	NicholasB	just reminding myself.
2016-02-25 16:10:33	@fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-25 16:10:54	NicholasB	i like one tech death band
2016-02-25 16:10:56	@fsociety	its like most of the time i skip the music on systemau... hahaha.. i confess
2016-02-25 16:11:02	NicholasB	does that count?
2016-02-25 16:11:10	@fsociety	and what tech death metal band is that
2016-02-25 16:11:16	NicholasB	all good mate. i expect most people do
2016-02-25 16:11:24	NicholasB	The Red Chord
2016-02-25 16:11:39	@fsociety	its been a while since i listened to those guys
2016-02-25 16:11:48	@fsociety	at least we can agree on one thing
2016-02-25 16:11:51	@fsociety	jono's music taste is questionable
2016-02-25 16:12:00	NicholasB	he's older than us.
2016-02-25 16:12:06	NicholasB	differnt childhood.
2016-02-25 16:12:14	@fsociety	oh i used to love megadeth as a kid, even used to listen to anthrax
2016-02-25 16:12:17	@fsociety	i grew out of it
2016-02-25 16:12:18	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-25 16:12:38	@fsociety	then my music teacher gave me a frank zappa vinyl and i kinda got stuck
2016-02-25 16:12:52	NicholasB	i gave all my zappa vinyl to a mate
2016-02-25 16:13:10	@fsociety	hate zappa that much hey.. haha
2016-02-25 16:13:23	NicholasB	ehh. i dont hate zappa i just can't be bothered
2016-02-25 16:13:30	NicholasB	i like fine girlk
2016-02-25 16:13:41	@fsociety	my first zappa album was weasel's ripped my flesh
2016-02-25 16:13:44	NicholasB	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRZpNfC-l54
2016-02-25 16:13:46	@fsociety	and that was still mothers of invention
2016-02-25 16:14:26	@fsociety	i've become less metal as i've become older also.. i've been stuck in porcupine tree mode for nearly 16 years now
2016-02-25 16:14:54	@fsociety	how old is jono
2016-02-25 16:14:57	LachlanHolmes	Vinyl is the shit!
2016-02-25 16:15:29	@fsociety	as much as vinyl is wonderful from a retro point of view i prefer 24bit 96000khz bluray albums
2016-02-25 16:15:59	@fsociety	i have a love for old 80s computers but i know if i sat down with one for more than a day i'd get irritated by it
2016-02-25 16:16:01	NicholasB	vinyl isn't about the sound. its about tactility.
2016-02-25 16:16:09	@fsociety	a true hipster
2016-02-25 16:16:19	LachlanHolmes	You don't just want sound you can hear. YOU WANT ALL THE SOUND!!
2016-02-25 16:16:29	NicholasB	fuck that. i've been collecting records since i kid.
2016-02-25 16:16:34	NicholasB	haaaa
2016-02-25 16:16:44	NicholasB	ALL OF THE SOUND.
2016-02-25 16:16:59	@fsociety	so to be fair its all about nostalgia
2016-02-25 16:17:00	@fsociety	lets be honest
2016-02-25 16:17:39	LachlanHolmes	Although to be fair I like flac. ð¯ð³
2016-02-25 16:17:51	@fsociety	95% of music collection is flac now
2016-02-25 16:18:01	@fsociety	unfortunately it makes my music collection 1.3tb
2016-02-25 16:18:32	@fsociety	my gf finally understood why i chose flac, i used her car stereo as the culprit.. and she was like "shit, now i can hear everything"
2016-02-25 16:18:33	@fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-25 16:18:50	LachlanHolmes	Lachlan has changed the channel: &quot;#Data hoarders 'r' us&quot;
2016-02-25 16:19:08	@fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-25 16:19:33	@fsociety	a lot of my music collection is stuff that is even hard to pirate
2016-02-25 16:19:57	@fsociety	i went through my dads old vinyl collection, and all my obscure purchases i bought from places like basement discs and converted them
2016-02-25 16:20:06	@fsociety	now that physical collection collects dust
2016-02-25 16:20:21	NicholasB	Oh i'f im downloading music it will be FLAC.
2016-02-25 16:20:30	NicholasB	thats why I like bandcamp.
2016-02-25 16:20:34	@fsociety	same
2016-02-25 16:20:36	@fsociety	i love bandcamp
2016-02-25 16:20:43	@fsociety	i got an album in 24bit FLAC from there
2016-02-25 16:20:49	@fsociety	take that vinyl
2016-02-25 16:20:49	@fsociety	lol
2016-02-25 16:21:31	@fsociety	haha.. naa vinyl is okay
2016-02-25 16:21:38	@fsociety	as long as the vinyls stay in good condition
2016-02-25 16:21:43	NicholasB	Yeah. Im sure that 24bit FLAC is great when you want to read the liner notes with out a sdcreen
2016-02-25 16:21:43	@fsociety	crack, pop.. crack crack.. pop
2016-02-25 16:21:46	LachlanHolmes	Yeah but can you beat the sound of a dirty stylus pop?....
2016-02-25 16:21:46	LachlanHolmes	 
2016-02-25 16:21:46	LachlanHolmes	Uh. Yes ð
2016-02-25 16:21:56	@fsociety	i hate that
2016-02-25 16:22:18	@fsociety	im a musician trying to learn the parts and the fucking crackles and pops makes it difficult for me to transcribe the music
2016-02-25 16:22:43	@fsociety	also i like to slow down parts with perfect pitch
2016-02-25 16:22:50	@fsociety	this is where vinyl has its limits
2016-02-25 16:22:53	@fsociety	but then again im not normal
2016-02-25 16:23:01	@fsociety	as many people in this channel have pointed out
2016-02-25 16:23:03	@fsociety	sigh
2016-02-25 16:23:17	NicholasB	ha.
2016-02-25 16:23:24	NicholasB	all good. no such things as normal.
2016-02-25 16:23:31	LachlanHolmes	It's OK your box is over there...
2016-02-25 16:23:31	LachlanHolmes	 
2016-02-25 16:23:31	LachlanHolmes	ð
2016-02-25 16:23:35	@fsociety	haha.. i just like ragging on vinyl
2016-02-25 16:23:41	@fsociety	just for the sake of it
2016-02-25 16:23:52	@fsociety	i actually adore my dads old vinyl collection
2016-02-25 16:24:07	NicholasB	move flac is far easier when your lease is up.
2016-02-25 16:24:11	NicholasB	ill give it that.
2016-02-25 16:24:20	@fsociety	thats the reason why i dont like physcial items
2016-02-25 16:24:25	@fsociety	i know i'll never own a house
2016-02-25 16:24:30	@fsociety	its fucking impossible
2016-02-25 16:24:35	NicholasB	actually part of the fun of vinyl is the care. replacing sleeves, cleaning catalouging
2016-02-25 16:24:45	@fsociety	i have to deal with that enough with my drumkit
2016-02-25 16:24:56	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-25 16:24:59	LachlanHolmes	Why no own house?
2016-02-25 16:25:10	@fsociety	cause i dont earn enough money... hmmmm...
2016-02-25 16:25:29	LachlanHolmes	For your area?
2016-02-25 16:25:34	@fsociety	i live in fairfield
2016-02-25 16:25:38	@fsociety	minimum 1.2mil per house
2016-02-25 16:25:43	@fsociety	no fucking way i'd could afford to buy here
2016-02-25 16:26:05	LachlanHolmes	In Vic or NSW?
2016-02-25 16:26:08	@fsociety	vic
2016-02-25 16:26:34	@fsociety	property boom in fairfield/alphington went through the roof
2016-02-25 16:26:39	LachlanHolmes	Oh OK I don't know Vic as well
2016-02-25 16:26:41	@fsociety	the whole population of this area is upper middle class now
2016-02-25 16:27:04	@fsociety	which irritates me, but i must say crime rate here is quite low.. surprisingly
2016-02-25 16:27:11	@fsociety	considering i live two blocks away from the hells angels
2016-02-25 16:27:25	LachlanHolmes	Gentrification!!!!!
2016-02-25 16:27:31	@fsociety	soda sopa

2016-02-25 16:28:30	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-25 16:28:36	NicholasB	for 3 years.
2016-02-25 16:28:37	@fsociety	fitzroy for example
2016-02-25 16:28:43	NicholasB	i lived in fairfieldbefore you did.
2016-02-25 16:28:43	@fsociety	used to be cheap as fuck
2016-02-25 16:28:48	@fsociety	gentrification destroyed that
2016-02-25 16:29:00	@fsociety	when did you move into fairfield
2016-02-25 16:29:10	@fsociety	and how do you know how long i've lived here
2016-02-25 16:29:10	NicholasB	well i was one street off
2016-02-25 16:29:10	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-25 16:29:13	NicholasB	i was in alphington
2016-02-25 16:29:16	@fsociety	same
2016-02-25 16:29:18	NicholasB	2006
2016-02-25 16:29:21	LachlanHolmes	Hipsters to me are wealthy hippies, right? Who aren't afraid of having money. Or any I completely wrong?
2016-02-25 16:29:22	@fsociety	im in alphington right on the border
2016-02-25 16:29:34	@fsociety	exactly, hipsters are actually quite wealthy
2016-02-25 16:30:03	NicholasB	hiopster is not really anything anymore is it. just  label bandied about for people who like good coffee and flannel
2016-02-25 16:30:10	@fsociety	i disagree
2016-02-25 16:30:25	@fsociety	hipsters appropriate different cultures and destroy them all in the process
2016-02-25 16:30:41	LachlanHolmes	They are the Borg.
2016-02-25 16:30:43	NicholasB	like white people

2016-02-25 16:31:54	@fsociety	though i don't hold it against him
2016-02-25 16:32:03	@fsociety	if i had to label myself

2016-02-25 21:51:24	NicholasB	i put in on my non dominant wrist AND said it was dominant and i was walking more in my office job than a girl who i knew walked to work
2016-02-25 21:51:57	EricT	I had a flex for 2 years, no probs, maybe yours was faulty, One thing Fitbit does is great service, you should ask for a replacement

2016-02-26 06:49:06	 - 	Mode ##systemau [+t]
2016-02-26 07:12:20	NicholasB	I would use that feature.
2016-02-26 07:12:37	NicholasB	I think telegram is great but there are some UI changes that would be useful.
2016-02-26 07:14:10	@fsociety	i forgot telegram had a UI. haha
2016-02-26 07:14:19	@fsociety	if i get the vape today i'll tell you btw
2016-02-26 07:16:04	NicholasB	you should do I sent it express post

2016-02-26 08:32:23	NicholasB	you're swell
2016-02-26 08:32:31	PaulGleeson	Thanks man, I'm trying to give up emacs
2016-02-26 08:44:33	CarlosLopez	urrrrgh
2016-02-26 08:44:46	PaulGleeson	?
2016-02-26 08:45:04	CarlosLopez	yeah. it's pre-coffee-carlos for good morning.
2016-02-26 08:45:13	CarlosLopez	just call me zombie boy
2016-02-26 08:45:30	NicholasB	hi zombie boy
2016-02-26 08:45:35	CarlosLopez	urrrgh
2016-02-26 09:05:21	@fsociety	best way is to never get into emacs
2016-02-26 09:05:31	@fsociety	and no probs
2016-02-26 09:05:42	PaulGleeson	But it does everything
2016-02-26 09:06:00	PaulGleeson	And it loves me until I forget how it likes its eggs
2016-02-26 09:07:03	@fsociety	does richard stallman yell at you everytime you leave whitespace
2016-02-26 09:07:36	PaulGleeson	He apologises the morning after
2016-02-26 09:07:53	CarlosLopez	THAT woke me up!
2016-02-26 09:08:14	PaulGleeson	Your welcome
2016-02-26 09:10:03	@fsociety	haha.. you can respond "look RMS, it isn't you .. it's me"
2016-02-26 09:10:48	PaulGleeson	Oh he knows
2016-02-26 09:21:54	@fsociety	haha
2016-02-26 09:22:14	NicholasB	odd question. I haven't had a swap partition on a pc for the past few years
2016-02-26 09:22:21	@fsociety	neither have i
2016-02-26 09:22:31	NicholasB	am I the only one who daesnt bother any more
2016-02-26 09:22:35	NicholasB	ohh good
2016-02-26 09:22:51	CarlosLopez	do you find that some apps crash? Or do you have like 16Gb of RAM?
2016-02-26 09:22:53	@fsociety	i think it is only relevent if you have small amounts of ram, or maybe run lots of vms
2016-02-26 09:22:59	@fsociety	i have 32gb
2016-02-26 09:23:03	NicholasB	I have 8 gig in my laptop
2016-02-26 09:23:10	NicholasB	and 16 on my desktop
2016-02-26 09:23:19	NicholasB	and all ssd
2016-02-26 09:23:28	@fsociety	even when i had 8gb it rarely used any swap
2016-02-26 09:23:38	NicholasB	I originally did it because my first ssd was first gen and small
2016-02-26 09:23:38	@fsociety	i think if the steam client went 64bit that would change a lot of things
2016-02-26 09:23:42	NicholasB	didn't want to wear it
2016-02-26 09:24:27	CarlosLopez	You mean to say I could have 8Gb more porn by not having &lt;swap&gt;?
2016-02-26 09:24:47	NicholasB	yes
2016-02-26 09:25:10	NicholasB	if you run msdos double space yau could have 16 gig
2016-02-26 09:46:09	@fsociety	there was another competitive product to that
2016-02-26 09:46:11	@fsociety	gonna find it
2016-02-26 09:47:42	NicholasB	it think it was a Norton product
2016-02-26 09:47:51	NicholasB	possibly called drive space
2016-02-26 09:49:55	@fsociety	superstor
2016-02-26 09:50:02	@fsociety	it was part of dr-dos 6.0
2016-02-26 09:50:13	CarlosLopez	sounds like the title of some mid-80s straight-to-video scifi movie
2016-02-26 09:50:16	@fsociety	which my dad bought cause he wanted an alternative to microsofts ms-dos
2016-02-26 09:50:23	@fsociety	here have an ms-dos manual
2016-02-26 09:50:40	@fsociety	http://www.thelegacypcproject.com/MS-Dos%206%20Concise%20User's%20Guide.pdf
2016-02-26 09:55:28	NicholasB	ohhhh double space was renamed to drive space
2016-02-26 09:56:36	@fsociety	yeah microsoft bought the tech
2016-02-26 09:56:50	@fsociety	i remember using all of them, and remember very clearly how slow my hdd's became after doing it
2016-02-26 09:56:57	NicholasB	yeah but it wasn't called drive space till 95
2016-02-26 09:57:06	NicholasB	double space was on dos only
2016-02-26 09:57:23	@fsociety	dr-dos 6.0 had an awesome shell to it
2016-02-26 09:57:26	@fsociety	i'll find a picture of it
2016-02-26 09:58:30	@fsociety	http://www.seasip.info/Gem/History/viewmax1.png
2016-02-26 09:58:53	NicholasB	nice.
2016-02-26 09:59:02	NicholasB	I still dn't think you can beat xtree gold
2016-02-26 10:00:35	CarlosLopez	now THERE's a name I haven't heard in years
2016-02-26 10:00:44	CarlosLopez	probably why I like MC now
2016-02-26 10:02:23	NicholasB	yeah I've been known to use MC on my netbook
2016-02-26 10:02:35	NicholasB	in a concerted efforht to keep it snappy
2016-02-26 10:05:03	@fsociety	go ranger
2016-02-26 10:05:17	@fsociety	in ranger you can have inline image preview like w3m but all console
2016-02-26 10:05:38	CarlosLopez	ranger's nice, but I haven't spent enough time on it to be comfortable yet
2016-02-26 10:05:59	@fsociety	https://github.com/hut/ranger.git
2016-02-26 10:06:10	@fsociety	dotshare.it has a ton of configs and themes for it
2016-02-26 10:06:17	Moritz	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkYHNO2vNG4
2016-02-26 10:07:35	CarlosLopez	fedora's got it as a package too
2016-02-26 10:08:06	CarlosLopez	Thanks Dean - I'll have a look
2016-02-26 10:12:13	NicholasB	any one here have an idea of how much bandwith citrix needs for a less than hd desktop?
2016-02-26 10:14:12	CarlosLopez	sorry no - though I can tell you I absolutely DETEST all the citrix-connected library management systems out there (mostly because they all seem to be beased out of the US and are horribly slow)
2016-02-26 10:14:27	CarlosLopez	*based*, of course
2016-02-26 10:14:29	NicholasB	we have a local server at work
2016-02-26 10:14:37	CarlosLopez	that sounds nicer
2016-02-26 10:14:38	NicholasB	but i'd kill to use linux
2016-02-26 10:15:02	NicholasB	so I was thinking I could bring my laptop in and just tether to my phone
2016-02-26 10:15:15	NicholasB	and run the citrix session on that
2016-02-26 10:15:27	CarlosLopez	if it's local, why not just terminal services?
2016-02-26 10:15:45	NicholasB	im not allowed to use chrome
2016-02-26 10:15:54	NicholasB	there is no way I would have acces to thant
2016-02-26 10:16:01	NicholasB	locked town to the hilt
2016-02-26 10:16:10	CarlosLopez	ah. Oh, yeah, you're stuck with IE (or whatever they're calling it now)
2016-02-26 10:16:11	NicholasB	nat even allowed to change the wallpaper
2016-02-26 10:17:44	NicholasB	just be nice to freely use a computer and still get my work done
2016-02-26 10:18:17	NicholasB	I have 6gig on my phone and it's only 10 buck for an extra gig
2016-02-26 10:20:35	CarlosLopez	so you'd use your phone (tethered) to connect your laptop (running Ubuntu) to your work's citrix server - should work, I guess. The Citrix client shouldn't be too resource-intensive.
2016-02-26 10:21:27	NicholasB	yeah its not resource intensive. just don't want to use 500 meg a day on citrix
2016-02-26 10:22:15	CarlosLopez	oh. Not sure then.
2016-02-26 10:22:15	NicholasB	I could prob get away with using the web mail in browsor and just use citrix for an hour a day actually.
2016-02-26 10:22:16	NicholasB	hmm
2016-02-26 10:22:44	CarlosLopez	Will they let you bring in your laptop and connect to the lan?
2016-02-26 10:23:53	NicholasB	nope
2016-02-26 10:24:01	CarlosLopez	ouch.
2016-02-26 10:24:14	NicholasB	but I can get permission for external citrix access
2016-02-26 10:25:55	CarlosLopez	yeah but then you're paying for the bandwidth. grrr.
2016-02-26 10:26:49	NicholasB	I get bored at work
2016-02-26 10:28:15	CarlosLopez	I take it you also can't run portable apps (http://portableapps.com/)?
2016-02-26 10:28:27	NicholasB	not anymore
2016-02-26 10:28:30	CarlosLopez	damn

2016-02-26 12:59:49	EricT	just let me cough up a bit of lung-custard...
2016-02-26 13:00:17	TristanJames	throat oysters

2016-02-26 14:11:43	CarlosLopez	I vote Fridays be cut by about 4 hours
2016-02-26 14:12:17	NicholasB	i like fridays
2016-02-26 14:12:24	NicholasB	you know they are going to end!
2016-02-26 14:12:36	CarlosLopez	me too - i just don't like working fridays
2016-02-26 14:26:25	Sean	I say we just go to 4 8-hour day work weeks.
2016-02-26 14:28:01	Sean	Or just getting paid for doing things we love to do.
2016-02-26 14:28:35	Sean	I've met a couple of those people. They seem to like their lives :)
2016-02-26 14:28:52	CarlosLopez	Indeed! Looking forward to it
2016-02-26 15:09:44	LachlanHolmes	My crowning achievement for my PC at work was I got the x2go client installed / unzipped the installer to my c:\users\lachlan\x2go\ folder and then pinned it to me start bar. Then setup a antergos vm at home or DO would work too and then x2go'd onto the desktop there and enjoy your home Internet connection or DO connt via a SSH encrypted session. ð if your corporate firewall doesn't like you going out on port 22 then
2016-02-26 15:09:44	LachlanHolmes	change your SSH server to run on port 443 or run sslh in a docker on the VM.
2016-02-26 15:54:14	LewisCividin	I need better networking knowledge I suck at network troubleshooting
2016-02-26 15:55:36	CarlosLopez	what seems to be the problem?
2016-02-26 15:56:12	LewisCividin	I don't know
2016-02-26 15:56:15	LewisCividin	haha
2016-02-26 15:56:34	CarlosLopez	ok, let me rephrase. What isn't happening that should?
2016-02-26 15:56:40	CarlosLopez	be?
2016-02-26 15:57:02	LewisCividin	reboot fixes the router but it just freezes or a disconnect from it. I reboot it and lose the logs
2016-02-26 15:58:24	LewisCividin	The router doesn't seem to have to function to send them anywhere.Â 
2016-02-26 15:58:46	CarlosLopez	What sort of router are talking about?
2016-02-26 15:58:53	CarlosLopez	*are we*
2016-02-26 15:59:02	LewisCividin	but I've no idea why it stops working firmware is up to date and it stops ethernet and wifi
2016-02-26 15:59:12	LewisCividin	Fritzbox 7940
2016-02-26 15:59:44	CarlosLopez	hang on
2016-02-26 16:14:42	CarlosLopez	It looks as though the fritzbox can send logs by email (http://goo.gl/KYS2sS) - have you aready set this up?
2016-02-26 16:18:05	LewisCividin	yeah
2016-02-26 16:18:39	LewisCividin	but it doesn't give me anything useful as it doesn't send an email before it locks up
2016-02-26 16:18:46	LewisCividin	I think it might just be heat
2016-02-26 16:19:39	LewisCividin	I wish it had like a serial connection that I could plug in to see if it was alive at all
2016-02-26 16:19:48	LewisCividin	or just completely hardlocked
2016-02-26 16:20:16	LewisCividin	but it drops wifi and looks like dhcp drops out
2016-02-26 16:20:37	LewisCividin	next time it does it I'll set a static ip and see if I can log in with ehternet
2016-02-26 16:21:03	LewisCividin	didn't think of that just got the shits and pulled the power lol
2016-02-26 16:22:29	CarlosLopez	yeah, doesn't sound promising. You might want to start saving up for a new router.
2016-02-26 16:25:06	LewisCividin	wasn't cheap that thing be sprewing if its faulty

2016-02-27 11:35:53	@fsociety	im not sure, but man im using it right now :)
2016-02-27 11:36:04	@fsociety	going to write an update manager for myself as well

2016-02-27 11:42:07	Moritz	What is the difference between a framework and a toolkit?
2016-02-27 11:42:34	@fsociety	not a lot
2016-02-27 11:42:43	@fsociety	framework is a bit more low level i'd imagine
2016-02-27 11:43:03	@fsociety	toolkit would have an easier module base
2016-02-27 11:49:19	Moritz	Thanks for the explanation!
2016-02-27 11:49:59	@fsociety	:) no probs

2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:06:42] had a copy of win7 home pre 64 bit on disc
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:06:50] recovery says its the wrong version.
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:06:59] got a dodgy disc of 32 bit version.
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:07:05] has no recovey option.
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:07:11] people help me out. what can i do?
2016-03-01 08:57:45	TristanJames	[2016-02-28 16:10:11] I wonder if upgrading to win 10 would work?
2016-03-01 08:57:45	TristanJames	[2016-02-28 16:10:38] You can download the install disc from Microsoft
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:11:24] nah it wont help till i can boot.
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:11:39] you used to be able to get official downloads through digitalriver
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:12:03] but now im struggling to find copys. they let you download it with the serial nu,mber but its not working.
2016-03-01 08:57:45	EricT	[2016-02-28 16:14:35] Maybe ultimate boot disk type can help
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:14:52] well ive gon back to the microsoft page
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:15:06] and ive entered the product key and its given me a download
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:15:15] it spend a long time thinking about it.
2016-03-01 08:57:45	NicholasB	[2016-02-28 16:15:41] hopefully that works.

2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 09:58:25] I don't know that it would - I just don't like the lack of testing on AUR repos (almost as bad as PPAs)
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 09:58:56] but then I'm paranoid (don't tel the men in the white coats)
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 09:59:13] don't be sexist.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 09:59:22] there are women in white coats as well
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 09:59:27] too right - the people in white coats
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 09:59:31] they judge you just as harsly

2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:07:05] Net-Edition
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:07:05] 
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:07:05] The NET edition of Manjaro provides a base installation without a pre-installed display manager, desktop environment, or any desktop software applications. It allows you to build your own version of Manjaro from the ground up.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:07:21] Downloading now.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 10:09:14] yeah i was thing of that. i prob should.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:09:22] Oh yeah! Nearly forgot! Happy Jump-around Day!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 10:09:42] any one have a birth day today?
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:09:52] THAT would be sad
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:26:05] Morning all, I been playing with i3 for a couple of days, and I like the workflow, but not sure is right for me, you need both hands on KB to do efficient Tiling and I more of a sloucher/one handed Mouse clicker, lol!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 10:26:52] Eric i3 has full mouse support
2016-03-01 08:57:59	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 10:27:08] Plus you can rebind everything under your left hand
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:27:37] but I like all my fancy extentions and clickity icons!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 10:28:12] Night
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:28:39] lefthand only? you must have some mofo dexterous long fingers(ladies must love you)
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:45:28] Can you have different virtual desktops with i3 or is the concept of the desktop &quot;whatever fits on your screen&quot;?
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:48:20] Yes lots of desktops and toggle between them
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:48:54] It's like DeCaprio's Inception
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:48:59] lol
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:49:51] I've been meaning to give tiling desktop managers a go for a while. Maybe I'll start today. When I get bored (5 minutes and counting).
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:50:41] look at this, quick and concise!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:50:41] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLyFcdJ411-pBeXkkLwqfnrLQAxhE-WPB2
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:51:15] Thanks Eric - I'll have a go
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:51:26] Tiling is great &quot;if you always keep both hand on the keyboard&quot;!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 10:51:54] ALT+TAB 4 life
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 10:52:00] lol
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 11:02:30] I think the best option is to have your favourite desktop+i3,  That way you have a standard experience when fark-arsing but you have i3 when you need shit to get done quick.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	TristanJames	[2016-02-29 11:05:45] Hey @F_s0c1ety have you tried this? http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/02/run-a-game-boy-emulator-in-terminal/
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 11:09:30] Will it run Pokemon Gold?
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 11:23:12] Having a look at a fedoramag article on i3 (https://fedoramagazine.org/getting-started-i3-window-manager/): &quot;Knowing the terminal helps&quot;. Yeah, thanks.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 11:54:08] Wow, never realised the native Ubuntu Twitter client was so big!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 11:54:08] http://i.imgur.com/MovXd5X.png
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 11:54:56] hmm. This feels pretty easy: WIN+up to change window focus, WIN+[X] (where X is a desktop number) to change virtual desktop, nice!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 11:57:00] sounds easy..try it on a Nbook with crappy chicklet keyboard and god damn fn key next to super key...ahhh!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 11:57:22] and big sausage fingers!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 11:57:50] Sausage fingers I have
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 13:21:11] http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/nbn-malcolm-turnbulls-faster-cheaper-rollout-falters-20160228-gn5l0s.html
2016-03-01 08:57:59	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 14:29:28] Ive been playing with i3wm it's great on my laptop, until I have an issue with say my router or something and I'm just wanting to do something I'm really familiar with in gnome/mousing etc then. Kinda getting used to all the keyboard commands is the toughest thing. I love how snappy it is. Breaks steam client if I try and add things in the steam desktop. That series of videos for it is great!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:30:13] it's like tiling window managers are the latest fad.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:31:20] I've been trying i3 for a couple of hours now and it just seems very comfortable (but then I'm not doing anything very complicated)
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:42:28] i should really give it a burl it would be nice if one of my monitors could do it and the other not
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:42:37] so my video
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:42:54] playlist ctah etc screen would be all tight and i could be slppy with my other screen
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:43:19] having steam not work properly with it is a dealbreaker for my home machine, though
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:43:50] you wouldn't want to just log in to a differ session for gaming?
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 14:49:34] yes, log in to preffered desktop when doing &quot;recreational&quot; Linuxing
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:49:37] hmmm, not sure. Maybe.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:50:05] And recreational linuxing is just about the only linuxing I've been doing at home lately
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:50:10] i don't know why but that sounds creepy
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:50:36] Ot's all right Nick - I wash my hands afterwards
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:50:52] *It's*
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 14:50:54] feet on desk, one hand on mouse, other hand scratching...lol
2016-03-01 08:57:59	CarlosLopez	[2016-02-29 14:51:16] Yeah, that sounds familiar
2016-03-01 08:57:59	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 14:51:33] my desk is too high for feet
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 14:51:44] I â¤ï¸ ricgkt click and drag n drop
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 14:52:00] right*
2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 15:07:44] You've seem my Chromebook Extreme! Recreationally!
2016-03-01 08:57:59	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 15:46:22] I'm going to persist with it I'd like to get the short cuts down and be able to get a mainly keyboard work flow
2016-03-01 08:57:59	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 17:54:37] There are dozens of us, who have been tiling for years. Dozens of us.
2016-03-01 08:57:59	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 17:54:50] Morning lads

2016-03-01 08:57:59	EricT	[2016-02-29 18:01:54] Tiling, rendering, sounds like a construction site ð

2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 18:04:51] aside from it being better and you being able to gloat
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 18:04:57] which is alway good
2016-03-01 08:58:07	Joe	[2016-02-29 18:10:10] Faster, 64bit and has wifi and Bluetooth

2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 18:17:09] If only that worked for work

2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 19:01:10] Google is so nice telling me to expect rain

2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 19:22:36] Never iron! Hate iron!

2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 21:14:50] @JoeRess what do you own?

2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 21:19:51] Nice
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:21:08] what will you do with it?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 21:23:16] I doubt even Joe knows
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:24:39] already on back order in australia

2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:49:52] turn some dotted lines in to solid ones as it were.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:49:56] :D
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 21:50:20] yeah im not a crazy bike rider aye... i just like to putter along.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 21:51:00] How is your wood's neck?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:51:13] not bad. summer is over i think.

2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 21:52:02] it will come back ð im sure of it.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:52:22] if 2016 could invent one tech thing, it would be accurate file copying progress bars.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 21:52:30] thats all i want.

2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:18:29] via ppa
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:19:20] but I need nvidia-340 or less
2016-03-01 08:58:07	MartinWimpress	[2016-02-29 22:20:46] There a one-click button for the nvidia PPA dance in Welcome for Ubuntu MATE 16.04 ð
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:23:04] I couldnt get it to work on Mate, trying on Gnome the notebook has a Quadro 140M a bit old now...
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:25:02] anyone got a specs link of the Pi3 at all? or is it to new?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	Moritz	[2016-02-29 22:25:08] The pi 3 is out.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:26:02] I saw something in here today briefly but was a busy day. Is it?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:26:20] 64bit wifi faster
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 22:27:19] Bluetooth too and WiFi n
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:27:28] nice anyone know what its like compared to the pine board ( I backed the pine)
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 22:27:57] pine is cheaper
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:28:53] That's good for me then haha
2016-03-01 08:58:07	Moritz	[2016-02-29 22:29:09] Is it BT 4?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:31:28] yep 4.1
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:31:30] https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:32:23] I hope they put some eMMC on-board flash SDcards to cut it!
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:32:36] dont cut*
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:34:56] My Beaglebone (eMMC) is super fast and has never had a storage error, RassPi all the time!
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 22:37:32] Pi 3 has the same CPU as the pine
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[2016-02-29 22:38:30] cool
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 22:39:50] The pine has higher resolution output, more ram (if you played for it) and a realtime time clock
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 22:42:02] Pines GPU is slightly better too
2016-03-01 08:58:07	Moritz	[2016-02-29 22:45:32] Has the Beagle BT and Wifi?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	EricT	[2016-02-29 22:45:59] ðnope
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 23:06:58] Today is flying
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 23:07:01] Its great
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 23:07:14] I've just enough work to keep busy
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 23:10:43] have you guys ever used your pi for https://volumio.org/?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 23:11:01] or do you think its a waist of a pi?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 23:14:12] That looks really cool
2016-03-01 08:58:07	PaulGleeson	[2016-02-29 23:14:25] But no I hadn't heard of it
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:38:39] I've used it. It's a little buggy. You want an external USB DAC though
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:38:52] Internal pi sounds shit.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:53:49] Right I'm going nuts. I feel like an idiot. How do I back up a while directory which contains fucking folder links? When I copy it just copy's the link which takes me back to the original location.  Thus not a back up at all.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:54:17] *whole
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 23:54:28] symlinks?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:54:39] What ever Windows uses.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:54:45] Symlinks I guess.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 23:55:13] so shortcuts?
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LachlanHolmes	[2016-02-29 23:55:14] :P
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:55:21] Well yeah.
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[2016-02-29 23:56:31] It driving me nuts. Took fucking hours to copy I check the back up and I get thrown to the drive I was copying from.

2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[07:28:59] Yeah
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[07:29:31] It's really 1:1 with moving and interacting with the environment
2016-03-01 08:58:07	LewisCividin	[07:30:40] Space for the set up might be a issue
2016-03-01 08:58:07	NicholasB	[07:32:31] my lounge is pretty empty
2016-03-01 08:58:07	TristanJames	[08:30:31] I've used it on an older Pi. As Nick said it's pretty buggy. I use PiMusicBox now and pretty happy with it. http://www.pimusicbox.com/
2016-03-01 10:18:53	NicholasB	@dj_salingerÂ do you have yours set up in a sweet box of just a mass of cables like mine?
2016-03-01 10:19:05	NicholasB	*or
2016-03-01 10:26:33	TristanJames	I have cases for all mine. The music box one is hidden in my old stereo cabinet as well.
2016-03-01 10:29:25	NicholasB	I've thought about getting an old stereo case like a tuner maybe then i can hide it
2016-03-01 10:29:27	NicholasB	i also have one of these sitting around i could hide inside

2016-03-01 11:22:19	NicholasB	it's not bad. i have the turntable pre amp too. has a bit of a low end buzz. don't us eit atm

2016-03-01 11:32:55	TristanJames	I got given a pretty decent amp and massive speakers last year. The only problem with the amp is the display doesn't light up. But it doesn't matter because again, it's hidden in the vintage cabinet.

2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] The latest update of the Github-repository of Telegram for Android has been two months ago and it is still on version 3.4.2.
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] 
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] It is understandable that Telegram waits a short time after a major update to fix bugs and publishs the source code after a few days, but two months (and skipping at least one major version) is way to long.
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] Basically Telegram for Android is NOT open source since two months and many developers that build apps on top of Telegram for Android depend on the update to add new functionalities to their apps (like for example @plusmsgr).
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] 
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] A self-proclaimed open source app can not stay closed source for two months!
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] 
2016-03-02 07:33:13	Moritz	[05:22:25] All the other Telegram apps (iOS, Web, Desktop, Mac) are published regularly.
2016-03-02 07:33:16	 - 	Mode ##systemau [+t]
2016-03-02 07:34:17	@fsociety	morning people.. have to get into work early this morning to boot up weird and bizarre unix dev machines.  our air con failed last night in the office and had to shutdown the machines
2016-03-02 07:36:54	@fsociety	Moritz: we should just make an ejabberd instance instead of telegram if we want to be totally open source :)
2016-03-02 07:37:03	PaulGleeson	Fuck
2016-03-02 07:37:46	@fsociety	it's not surprising really
2016-03-02 07:38:04	@fsociety	i wait for the open source alternatives of telegram :)
2016-03-02 08:05:49	Moritz	Please not jabber. At least not without all the XEPs. I used fdroid so i never use the non-free telegram client. But still that is annoying.
2016-03-02 08:05:54	Moritz	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1YIrKyR3VU
2016-03-02 08:06:22	Moritz	Have you bought the Humble Bundle 16?
2016-03-02 08:09:03	@fsociety	Moritz: i own 98% of those games already :)
2016-03-02 08:10:55	@fsociety	though since the glvnd extensions inthe nvidia drivers - steam has been all a bit haywire
2016-03-02 08:11:14	@fsociety	mind youi think a lot of that is coming from the fact my wd black is failing, only discovered that other day
2016-03-02 08:11:34	@fsociety	and luckily i spare wd black, have to pick it up from my friends house tonight
2016-03-02 08:14:21	Moritz	@F_s0c1ety do you use a RAID solution?
2016-03-02 08:15:32	@fsociety	not on my desktop.  my desktop has 3 ssds.  1 for linux, 1 for windows and 1 for steam games.  and a 2tb black drive for all the random stuff and games that dont fit on the ssds
2016-03-02 08:16:02	@fsociety	the games that i was trying to play and were hard locking was on the black drive
2016-03-02 08:16:31	@fsociety	made me make a cronjob to get smartctl to send me an email if it discovers issues via the smart selftest for future
2016-03-02 08:16:38	@fsociety	more annoyingly its a six month old black drive
2016-03-02 08:16:43	@fsociety	"oh we are so enterprise"
2016-03-02 08:21:31	Moritz	:) You could do LVM for the linux stuff. You can do caching and pin data to a specific PV. Or do you use the same steam partition for linux and windows?
2016-03-02 08:23:29	@fsociety	for win and linux
2016-03-02 08:23:40	@fsociety	two partitions.. one ntfs and one ext4
2016-03-02 08:23:45	@fsociety	halfed evenly..
2016-03-02 08:23:47	@fsociety	its a 480gb
2016-03-02 08:23:53	@fsociety	its the same with the black drive
2016-03-02 08:24:00	@fsociety	half ntfs and half ext4
2016-03-02 08:24:09	@fsociety	wish windows supported ext4 "properly"
2016-03-02 08:24:37	@fsociety	refuse to use ntfs, cause lets face it ntfs-3g uses way too much cpu at the best of times for i/o
2016-03-02 08:24:38	Moritz	Then do LVM, (or not because it already works)!
2016-03-02 08:24:47	@fsociety	ill look it up
2016-03-02 08:25:06	@fsociety	have you got a nice article i could read regarding lvm
2016-03-02 08:25:18	Moritz	Is the http://freenas.org down for you? isup.me says yes and i can't get anything.
2016-03-02 08:26:04	Moritz	Let me think a bit about it. Not right at hand. But i can always recommend the RedHat documentation for it.
2016-03-02 08:27:26	@fsociety	ah alright.. i guess the archwiki would be a good place. it always is - no matter the distro :)
2016-03-02 08:29:05	Moritz	You might be interested in this article. It compares bcache and LVM caching. Although it might be outdated because bcache might got some updates since the article was released: https://blog-vpodzime.rhcloud.com/?p=45
2016-03-02 08:31:01	@fsociety	Moritz: thank i'll definetly check it out, picking up my spare black drive putting an rma in for the dead one
2016-03-02 08:31:11	Moritz	One nice feature of LVM, migrating a running system to another disk: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/123399/til_how_to_move_my_entire_system_to_a_second/
2016-03-02 08:32:31	@fsociety	ye i've been meaning to look into LVM, just needed an excuse... now i can :)
2016-03-02 10:10:53	CarlosLopez	Hi folks
2016-03-02 10:11:33	CarlosLopez	i3 update: ClusterSSH looks funny on i3
2016-03-02 10:13:21	CarlosLopez	<br><img id="3">
2016-03-02 10:23:55	@fsociety	moooanin'
2016-03-02 10:25:52	@fsociety	i'm spending my morning compiling ue4 engine and editor
2016-03-02 10:25:56	@fsociety	see if i can succeed this time
2016-03-02 10:46:26	LachlanHolmes	@enjayembeeÂ

2016-03-02 11:04:18	NicholasB	thats a lot
2016-03-02 11:07:38	NicholasB	<br><img id="4">
2016-03-02 11:07:39	NicholasB	finally
2016-03-02 11:23:50	@fsociety	guessing that is your home machine
2016-03-02 11:23:57	NicholasB	yeah. on monitor is older than the other two. need to wait till its dark and tweak
2016-03-02 11:24:01	NicholasB	yeah thats my home setup.
2016-03-02 11:24:06	@fsociety	what backend are you using for multiple monitors
2016-03-02 11:24:10	@fsociety	xinerama, xrandr, etc?
2016-03-02 11:24:22	NicholasB	just the nvidia prob drivers one
2016-03-02 11:24:27	NicholasB	*prop
2016-03-02 11:28:12	@fsociety	ahh.. do you have any weird issues with vsync not applying on certain monitors
2016-03-02 11:28:20	@fsociety	its been so long since i've tried multi-monitor setups on linux
2016-03-02 11:29:24	NicholasB	not so far.
2016-03-02 11:29:40	NicholasB	it took no config. all plug and play.
2016-03-02 11:31:03	@fsociety	hmm.. maybe one day i'll get a second monitor again
2016-03-02 11:31:07	@fsociety	at this point i dont need one
2016-03-02 11:31:22	NicholasB	no one neeeeeeds
2016-03-02 11:31:26	NicholasB	two or three monitors.
2016-03-02 11:34:30	LachlanHolmes	i have 3 monitors on ubuntu 15.10...
2016-03-02 11:34:38	LachlanHolmes	using a gtx970.
2016-03-02 11:34:58	@fsociety	i'd struggle to fit two 32" ultra widescreen curved monitors on my desktop
2016-03-02 11:35:18	LachlanHolmes	yeah i only have a 22 + 27 + 24. so yah
2016-03-02 11:35:52	NicholasB	ohhh thats right you have an ultra wide. that pascially is two monitor though
2016-03-02 11:36:11	NicholasB	*basically
2016-03-02 11:36:28	@fsociety	why i bought it
2016-03-02 11:36:31	@fsociety	current res is 3440x1440
2016-03-02 11:36:35	@fsociety	so 2k ultra wide
2016-03-02 11:36:55	@fsociety	and you can input two different signals at once on the one display as well. so picture in picture if you will
2016-03-02 11:36:56	NicholasB	we i 100 percent see why you dont think you need two monitors
2016-03-02 11:37:02	NicholasB	ha
2016-03-02 11:37:19	@fsociety	i also hate the whole bevel thing
2016-03-02 11:39:01	@fsociety	ps. finally feel comfortable with that vap. the blueberry and the caramel are pretty nice.  the cinammon one just makes me cough - and for someone unknown reason doesn't give me the nicotone buzz i require. but the other two are fine
2016-03-02 11:39:39	NicholasB	cool. if you want easy nic vape juice, soulblu.co.nz is your bed.
2016-03-02 11:39:48	NicholasB	i reckon they ship locally
2016-03-02 11:39:56	NicholasB	though  they say its from nz
2016-03-02 11:41:26	@fsociety	ahh i'll check it out now
2016-03-02 11:43:17	@fsociety	ooo. vanilla bean
2016-03-02 11:43:27	@fsociety	nana cream pie.. interesting
2016-03-02 11:48:42	NicholasB	they are a good mid ground. there are great flavours in the usa but you pay through the nose.
2016-03-02 11:49:29	@fsociety	yeah i don't particularly want to pay through the nose
2016-03-02 11:49:32	@fsociety	im trying to save money
2016-03-02 11:49:32	@fsociety	haha
2016-03-02 12:11:13	@fsociety	a day in the cli - compiling ue4
2016-03-02 12:11:18	@fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/Zvsey.png
2016-03-02 12:11:22	@fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/giEzp.png
2016-03-02 12:11:27	@fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/OCpV3.png
2016-03-02 13:25:41	@fsociety	nice to ue4 uses my resources wisely https://u.teknik.io/uD9m1.png
2016-03-02 13:28:06	CarlosLopez	Jayzus! Are you rendering stuff there?
2016-03-02 13:30:31	@fsociety	compiling unreal4
2016-03-02 13:31:13	CarlosLopez	Wow! There's no way I'm even going to try (I'd fry my poor old cheap laptop at home!)
2016-03-02 13:31:51	@fsociety	yeah its gonna take a while to compile even on my machine
2016-03-02 13:33:49	NicholasB	hey you still have .7 of cpu left.
2016-03-02 13:34:03	@fsociety	hahaha.. at that given second :)
2016-03-02 13:36:57	NicholasB	its more than a pocket calcultor. do your budget with it.
2016-03-02 13:38:25	@fsociety	first successful compile of ue4 though.. makes me happy.  compiling my friends ue4 project on linux to see the performance differences between the dx renderer and the opengl reenderer
2016-03-02 13:41:37	NicholasB	sweet.
2016-03-02 13:42:54	@fsociety	ill keep you posted on the differences. my friends project uses the photo realistic shaders.  its essentially an interactive project of the new mcg upgrade. he is designing it
2016-03-02 13:46:47	@fsociety	ue4 is currently using 6.5gb of RAM to compile. only at module 93 of 788. urgh

2016-03-02 14:27:07	NicholasB	lol. he's just a voice actor who i found on fiver a few years ago when i needed some fake radio announcements for alil project
2016-03-02 14:27:12	NicholasB	they were great i kept him on
2016-03-02 14:28:39	NicholasB	gray gray just seems like a good name :)
2016-03-02 14:31:35	@fsociety	i remember when i was creating an old video game - i magically found one of the voice actors from the lord of the rings mmo.  he was really cool and did all the VO work for free on my free game
2016-03-02 14:31:40	@fsociety	you can find some great people out there
2016-03-02 14:36:23	ScottHuntley	I like Grey Gray
2016-03-02 14:36:31	LachlanHolmes	Anyone else think he sounds a bit like Shaun?
2016-03-02 14:37:13	EricT	Ive seen the Video, it aint Shaun, lol
2016-03-02 14:37:22	LachlanHolmes	Must be me. Anyway his like a verbal 'stig'.
2016-03-02 14:37:31	NottheOtherDan	Gray Gray is cutesy for Graham.
2016-03-02 14:37:58	NottheOtherDan	We imagined hime wearing brown velour suits with purple paisley shirts.

2016-03-02 16:53:25	CarlosLopez	yeah but it looks like it's in French. And I don't really write French.
2016-03-02 16:54:48	@fsociety	haha. most likely all the documentation is in english though. haha
2016-03-02 16:56:34	CarlosLopez	Looks pretty friendly: apache OR nginx, mysql/MariaDB OR Postgresql. Php, though.
2016-03-02 16:57:41	CarlosLopez	Question 1 (not irrelevant, seeing as the forums were hacked): security?
2016-03-02 17:00:13	CarlosLopez	I like this: &quot;You want to stay anonymous?
2016-03-02 17:00:13	CarlosLopez	You don't have to provide any personal information to join.&quot;

2016-03-06 10:50:04	NicholasB	I will if i stab myself in the leg with a kitchen knife.
2016-03-06 10:50:21	Joe	But you won't
2016-03-06 10:51:11	NicholasB	if we talk about it enough it could get noteworthy. I could make it a focal point in my memory.
2016-03-06 10:51:37	Joe	What if you went and bought some caustic soda
2016-03-06 10:51:51	Joe	And then wet your lips and kissed your hand
2016-03-06 10:52:02	Joe	Then poured the caustic soda on in
2016-03-06 10:52:27	Joe	And only poured vinegar on it just before you passed out from the pain
2016-03-06 10:52:58	NicholasB	you watching fight club?
2016-03-06 10:53:03	NicholasB	:D
2016-03-06 10:53:23	Joe	I don't need to watch it
2016-03-06 10:53:38	Joe	Or groundhog day
2016-03-06 10:53:53	NicholasB	ive only seen groundhog day once or twice.
2016-03-06 10:54:00	Joe	I'd fight ned ryerson
2016-03-06 10:54:19	NicholasB	I'd pay 5 bucks AUD to watch that.
2016-03-06 10:55:32	Joe	It's not always about money
2016-03-06 10:56:18	Joe	Tyler's question used to echo in my mind: How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?
2016-03-06 10:56:28	Joe	So I started one and lost
2016-03-06 10:56:42	Joe	It turns out the answer is quite a lot
2016-03-06 10:56:59	Joe	But a tiny bit more afterwards
2016-03-06 10:57:29	NicholasB	I'm glad I've not decided to find out that bit of information.
2016-03-06 10:57:43	Joe	I'm ambivalent
2016-03-06 10:58:00	Joe	I'm ultimately glad that I know
2016-03-06 10:58:21	Joe	And glad that I won't do it again
2016-03-06 10:59:04	Joe	But that's not relevant
2016-03-06 10:59:12	Joe	What is relevant is
2016-03-06 10:59:30	Joe	Where is the fucking video show you bunch of fraudsters?
2016-03-06 10:59:40	NicholasB	i think we need freesoftware showdown. Developers proving their code in the ring.
2016-03-06 10:59:59	NicholasB	we can call the ring 'The CPU'
2016-03-06 11:00:19	Joe	I want my money back
2016-03-06 11:00:39	NicholasB	ahhh. its coming.
2016-03-06 11:00:47	NicholasB	buying part with this patreon money
2016-03-06 11:00:49	Joe	I didn't support your patreon to not get a video show
2016-03-06 11:00:53	Joe	Oh wait
2016-03-06 11:01:01	Joe	I didn't support your patreon
2016-03-06 11:01:06	NicholasB	yeah i know you didnt
2016-03-06 11:01:08	Joe	As you were
2016-03-06 11:01:46	Joe	I desperately need a name for the live podcast event
2016-03-06 11:02:00	NicholasB	its just linux podcasts?
2016-03-06 11:02:04	NicholasB	or a bit more broad
2016-03-06 11:02:28	Joe	It's mostly Linux but also Aq and Dave from geek news radio
2016-03-06 11:03:16	Joe	At this point I'll accept anything that isn't Podbrazzers
2016-03-06 11:03:20	NicholasB	cool
2016-03-06 11:03:34	NicholasB	Have you thought of Podbrazze.....
2016-03-06 11:03:37	NicholasB	nrvmind
2016-03-06 11:03:53	Joe	<br><img id="65">
2016-03-06 11:04:07	Joe	I really need a name
2016-03-06 11:04:15	NicholasB	PodSeed?
2016-03-06 11:04:39	Joe	Exists
2016-03-06 11:05:00	NicholasB	LiPoCaCon
2016-03-06 11:05:53	Joe	Flacfest
2016-03-06 11:06:19	NicholasB	does any one post flac podcasts?
2016-03-06 11:06:26	Joe	No :(
2016-03-06 11:07:07	NicholasB	I'm sure there is a some audiophile podcast that does
2016-03-06 11:07:12	Joe	Probably
2016-03-06 11:07:19	Joe	Flacers
2016-03-06 11:07:31	Joe	Sounds a bit like soft cocks
2016-03-06 11:07:44	NicholasB	it does.
2016-03-06 11:08:48	Joe	Fuck it
2016-03-06 11:08:52	Joe	RessCon
2016-03-06 11:10:19	NicholasB	ConRess
2016-03-06 11:11:14	Joe	Linux Podcast Event
2016-03-06 11:11:50	NicholasB	'Generic Linux Internet Broadcasts'
2016-03-06 11:11:55	NicholasB	or GLIB for short
2016-03-06 11:13:37	Joe	My Ideal Linux Fun
2016-03-06 11:15:17	Joe	Mondeal International Linux Festival
2016-03-06 11:15:41	NicholasB	Ha.
2016-03-06 11:16:30	Joe	I'm seriously leaning towards Linux Podcast Event
2016-03-06 11:16:49	NicholasB	but would that look good on a shirt.
2016-03-06 11:17:04	NicholasB	after the even the sinage lives on.
2016-03-06 11:17:10	NicholasB	the event
2016-03-06 11:17:39	Joe	Given that the venue holds 50 people at a push I'm not that worried
2016-03-06 11:18:04	NicholasB	oh really? you'll pack that out no worries
2016-03-06 11:18:12	Joe	Yeah
2016-03-06 11:18:16	Joe	That's the plan
2016-03-06 11:18:51	Joe	It was either get a tiny place for free and ram it or have stress about deposits and shit
2016-03-06 11:19:03	NicholasB	fair enough.
2016-03-06 11:19:17	NicholasB	makes sense.
2016-03-06 11:19:17	Joe	If 500 people turn up it's a good problem
2016-03-06 11:19:35	Joe	If 25 turn up it's a fun night
2016-03-06 11:19:40	NicholasB	ticketed
2016-03-06 11:19:42	NicholasB	?
2016-03-06 11:19:50	Joe	Yeah
2016-03-06 11:19:59	Joe	Pay what you want
2016-03-06 11:20:04	Joe	Including fuck all
2016-03-06 11:20:27	Joe	The pub upstairs holds loads more people
2016-03-06 11:20:40	Joe	And I don't expect everyone to watch every show
2016-03-06 11:21:12	Joe	If it ends up being massively popular I'll do the next one somewhere bigger
2016-03-06 11:26:50	NicholasB	sweet.
2016-03-06 11:27:03	NicholasB	i look forward to hearing the recordings
2016-03-06 11:28:28	Joe	If all goes to plan it will be 45 mins each of LL, Ubuntu, Linux Voice and misc drunken show (Aq, Dave and whoever)
2016-03-06 11:28:51	Joe	Linux Voice will get the prime slot
2016-03-06 11:29:42	Joe	If Jono happens to be in London that day he is more than welcome
2016-03-06 11:29:53	Joe	But it's highly unlikely
2016-03-06 11:30:11	NicholasB	cool
2016-03-06 11:30:15	Joe	Same for Fab
2016-03-06 11:31:00	Joe	Dan will likely be better by then and so I'd love to have him there
2016-03-06 11:31:37	Joe	It's a very small venue for such a large talent pool
2016-03-06 11:32:10	Joe	But I want to start small
2016-03-06 11:32:22	NicholasB	what it called ill google it
2016-03-06 11:32:40	Joe	The Harrison kings cross
2016-03-06 11:33:01	Joe	http://harrisonbar.co.uk
2016-03-06 11:34:40	NicholasB	looks good
2016-03-06 11:34:56	Joe	Yeah they have a decent selection of drinks
2016-03-06 11:35:04	Joe	It's near central London
2016-03-06 11:35:08	Joe	It's free
2016-03-06 11:35:14	Joe	It's win all round
2016-03-06 11:35:32	Joe	They even have a few hotel rooms for rich folks
2016-03-06 11:37:08	Joe	http://oggcamp.org/the-ghost-of-oggcamp-yet-to-come
2016-03-06 11:37:29	Joe	If this doesn't happen there might be more people coming to my thing
2016-03-06 11:37:41	Joe	But hopefully someone will take on the challenge
2016-03-06 11:37:46	Joe	And we can do both
2016-03-06 11:38:18	NicholasB	or you could take on ogg camp ;)
2016-03-06 11:38:37	Joe	I've already officially declined
2016-03-06 11:39:04	Joe	It's one thing to organise what's essentially a piss up one Saturday in a pub
2016-03-06 11:39:13	Joe	Oggcamp is next level
2016-03-06 11:39:22	Joe	Maybe next year
2016-03-06 11:39:44	NicholasB	indeed.
2016-03-06 11:40:18	Joe	I'd been planning my thing before oggcamp started to look unlikely
2016-03-06 11:40:52	Joe	But when it became clear that the odds were against it I actually got my arse in gear
2016-03-06 11:52:26	EricT	I thought I lived in a quiet town, but! So many people, so much steam and so many train-spotting tragics!
2016-03-06 11:52:26	EricT	http://www.thirlmerefestivalofsteam.com/
2016-03-06 11:53:08	NicholasB	It's Australia's PREMIER Steam Event!
2016-03-06 11:53:26	EricT	I know, I thought the same thing
2016-03-06 11:53:51	NicholasB	Lots of men tending to loud and mostly useless engines.
2016-03-06 11:53:56	EricT	Next year you can do a live podcast here, makes sense? lol
2016-03-06 11:54:29	EricT	And all the kids, yelling &quot;Thomas&quot;!!!
2016-03-06 11:54:32	NicholasB	sure. or you could record it now and we'll mix it in to the next episode
2016-03-06 11:55:14	EricT	Lots and Lots of &quot;old white men&quot;
2016-03-06 11:55:36	NicholasB	yup.
2016-03-06 11:55:41	NicholasB	they love steam.
2016-03-06 11:55:54	NicholasB	they installed steam
2016-03-06 11:56:01	NicholasB	and got dissapoint it was about games
2016-03-06 11:56:01	EricT	Nostalgia is a bitch!
2016-03-06 11:56:10	NicholasB	and not steam.
2016-03-06 11:56:37	EricT	Yes, unless they buy &quot;Trainz 2015&quot;
2016-03-06 11:56:44	NicholasB	ohhh true dat
2016-03-06 11:56:56	NicholasB	i know a guy who has a train console setup
2016-03-06 11:57:04	NicholasB	so he could play trainz
2016-03-06 11:58:00	EricT	So Sad....Lets build a brand new High Tech PC so we can emulate some outdated Tech that is no longer relevant
2016-03-06 11:59:14	NicholasB	Thats the plan. OS's will start to get inspired by the past like music.
2016-03-06 11:59:29	NicholasB	'dude the os's in the 2030s were 90's retro'
2016-03-06 12:00:20	EricT	Like I said Nostalgia is a delusional bitch!
2016-03-06 12:01:34	EricT	Like Rockers wanting to go back and live in the 50s, if they did go they would hate it, especially the &quot;non-whit, ethnic&quot; ones

2016-03-07 00:22:32	LewisCividin	[2016-03-06 18:14:06] Hello Mathias, Welcome!
2016-03-07 00:22:32	Mathias	[2016-03-06 20:14:10] Hello.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:20:55] Nicholas B changed photo.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:21:04] hello.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:21:09] good evening all.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	AlanPope	[2016-03-06 20:37:49] Mornings
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:38:17] sunday mornings. the best kind.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	AlanPope	[2016-03-06 20:43:29] Ya
2016-03-07 00:22:32	TristanJames	[2016-03-06 20:49:15] Hey @enjayembee are you going to give Mathias you're usual warning?
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:49:30] i did in the email. :)
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:49:38] notifications off :D
2016-03-07 00:22:32	TristanJames	[2016-03-06 20:49:49] :)
2016-03-07 00:22:32	TristanJames	[2016-03-06 20:50:02] *your
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:50:44] its okay. the internet has made me 'your' blind.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	TristanJames	[2016-03-06 20:51:59] Ha, you must have internetted a hell of a lot because I'm not blind to it yet!
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 20:53:15] i dont like to boast.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	Mathias	[2016-03-06 21:06:29] Got the warning and wondered about every minute without a message. Now that I picked up the phone again I am glad I got the warning.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 21:07:11] haha. yeah conversation levels fluctuate.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	Mathias	[2016-03-06 21:14:07] Wow, the english Version of Android's auto correction is so much more useful compared to the german.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	Mathias	[2016-03-06 21:15:16] Must be great when most of the words do not look alike and need manual correction all the time.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NicholasB	[2016-03-06 21:16:31] ha it is. its even better when it learns your most common words. you never accidentally type duck again.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	Mathias	[2016-03-06 21:17:56] That sounds like a challenge for me ð.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	EricT	[2016-03-06 22:06:51] Intersting...
2016-03-07 00:22:32	EricT	[2016-03-06 22:06:51] http://www.ocsmag.com/2016/03/06/game-nearly-over/
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:40:17] Shocking, isnt it?
2016-03-07 00:22:32	EricT	[2016-03-06 23:41:25] Not just a walled garden, a Domed Garden!
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:41:31] haha
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:41:46] Direct X11 is a big contributor to that imo
2016-03-07 00:22:32	EricT	[2016-03-06 23:42:33] wait for DirectX12, win 10 only and no backward compat.
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:43:07] Everyone complains about Apples business practice
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:43:15] and yet the look at that, and have no issue?
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:43:20] It's bizarre
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:43:55] Im not condoning Apple for a single moment, but I barely, if ever, hear about DirectX as an issue, despite implications
2016-03-07 00:22:32	EricT	[2016-03-06 23:44:32] Here is a good rant:

2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:45:40] I tried playing a brand new release BluRay on Windows today
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:45:48] Wouldnt play on VLC
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:46:09] AAC libraries couldnt decode it
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:46:11] What a joke
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:46:22] Legit owned copy, cant even watch it
2016-03-07 00:22:32	EricT	[2016-03-06 23:46:42] Thats why we only use Nix!
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:47:01] Ive become quite vocal about all this stuff lately to non-technical folks
2016-03-07 00:22:32	NotDan	[2016-03-06 23:47:27] Starting to win them over, especially when they bought movies in the UK, now their Apple products wont play them as theyre in Aus

2016-03-08 08:34:04	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 19:49:32] i just realised i said the name of the program twice. It's clearly a monday.
2016-03-08 08:34:04	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:53:24] Guess it depends who you hang out with really, and age group.
2016-03-08 08:34:04	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:53:33] I prefre fucknut and arsecandle
2016-03-08 08:34:04	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:53:49] because of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaeecIwCqk0

2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 19:55:47] <br><img id="4">
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 19:56:23] Fuck A man, there just lovely.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 19:57:10] still need to buy a new board with browns or blues.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 19:57:14] but it'll tide me over
2016-03-08 08:34:08	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:57:23] I want a proper mech keyboard
2016-03-08 08:34:08	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:57:30] but I want one with a nipple :(
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 19:57:46] ohh i think unikey or who every they are do a nipple one
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 19:58:27] Have a look at the code with browns. It has Dvorak as a dip switch option so you could leave your PC in a Us layout and still have dvorak
2016-03-08 08:34:08	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:58:49] yeah, unicomp
2016-03-08 08:34:08	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 19:58:51] they do
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 19:59:09] it will be alittle while yet. have other things to get.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:00:13] ive noticed I actually type better with the blank keys because i look at the screen not my fingers.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:00:29] i've always looked at my fingers even though I don't need to.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 20:05:48] Same
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 20:06:38] Plus people think you have terrifying ability
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:06:50] oh yeah. intimidating.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:07:10] im listening to this live stream and it mixed heavy on the left.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:07:17] its genuinley very annoying.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 20:07:21] When really its just I can do something I do 8+ hours a day without looking at it
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 20:07:37] actually you've just reminded me @enjayembee; your podcasts seem really quiet for me
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 20:07:55] Bad audio be dammed
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 20:07:56] I always have to crank up the volume to hear you guys alright, when everything else i listen to is fine at the same original volume level
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:08:18] yeah its a struggle because i don't like to compress the hell out of the recoridng.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:08:22] i like the sound of air.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 20:08:34] I disagree, I find all podcasts quiet
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:09:19] LLuddites is loud and compressed. done well (not a diss @JoeRess)
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 20:09:21] it's not a huge issue for me
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 20:09:25] just thought id let you know
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:09:36] yeah cool.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:09:49] ill keep it in mind and see if i can tweak the compression.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:09:55] i just installed a new compressor
2016-03-08 08:34:08	EricT	[2016-03-07 20:50:46] This talk reminds me of Revheads! how much boost you running, bro?
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:51:01] 5 boosts
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:51:05] some time 6 boosts
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 20:51:07] if i have time.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	EricT	[2016-03-07 20:51:22] Does you compressor have a blow-out valve?
2016-03-08 08:34:08	EricT	[2016-03-07 20:52:02] lol that's a lumpy cam!
2016-03-08 08:34:08	LewisCividin	[2016-03-07 22:32:57] I've found luddites to suddenly drop in volume though on pocketcasts like the last two episodes dunno why. I've got it in headphones and I think it's paused but I just need to turn it right up
2016-03-08 08:34:08	AlanPope	[2016-03-07 22:33:49] not noticed that
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 22:34:01] i noticed jessie clips out a bit.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 22:34:08] thats about it quality wise
2016-03-08 08:34:08	LewisCividin	[2016-03-07 22:34:26] Oh it's a great podcast really enjoy it
2016-03-08 08:34:08	LewisCividin	[2016-03-07 22:34:46] It could be the volume rocker turn down in my pocket also
2016-03-08 08:34:08	LewisCividin	[2016-03-07 22:34:58] but it's just been the last two episodes
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 22:37:44] im not used to fortnightly episode yet!
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 22:37:51] i keep looking on a monday.

2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 23:23:26] And that was I don't know when

2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:25:30] ha. yeah i said that mid feb. youd have it by now.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:25:43] just going through old messages. My bad.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	PaulGleeson	[2016-03-07 23:28:20] No problem boss, were the same
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:31:36] what is that from
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:31:56] the gif? i just searched hi-5
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:32:18] ah
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:32:29] I thought it was Hillary Clinton on the right initially
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:33:01] it is isn't it
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:33:09] I cant tell
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:33:27] I desperately hope Bernie Sanders wins the nomination over her. If her or Trump- or both- win the nomination, then that's it. The credibility of the USA is nil
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:33:58] it will def be hil. i think cruz will get the nomintation.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:34:24] Even then as a 'the dems are the lesser evil' person; I still think Hillary is the best of a bad situation
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:34:42] The fact her husband was president
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:34:44] I mean...
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:34:49] elizabeth warren faded in to obscurity.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:34:57] i was surprised.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:35:03] At this point, sure- maybe she didnt want the presidency
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:35:11] Maybe she knows something we don't
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:35:34] Let her continue to be effective in her current position
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:35:38] as she has been
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:35:43] hmmm.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:35:45] any how

2016-03-08 08:34:08	NicholasB	[2016-03-07 23:36:02] as much as I want to type on my keyboard all night.
2016-03-08 08:34:08	NotDan	[2016-03-07 23:36:06] haha

2016-03-09 09:22:07	NicholasB	digital ocean. updates via ppa i think
2016-03-09 09:22:56	Moritz	Apt will notify you about broken dependencies. But they change the package structure so thats fine. (Backup, Backup, Backup, etc).
2016-03-09 09:23:33	@fsociety	owncloud 9 was rls'd... ooo.. going to update then
2016-03-09 09:23:46	@fsociety	have to check out the new features.. but first make snapshot
2016-03-09 09:28:26	Moritz	Hmm Webdav with Windows is flaky in 9. Or maybe my network is in a weird state. :(
2016-03-09 09:30:28	@fsociety	what new features does owncloud 9 bring?
2016-03-09 09:30:59	Moritz	Comments for files. Better activity stream. New updater. Hopefully a webdav bugfix for OSX.

2016-03-09 10:22:26	NicholasB	i figured it would be a back end issue as i useÂ  the web browser version
2016-03-09 10:23:09	@fsociety	have you tried using a different application to see if it is a website backend issue?
2016-03-09 10:23:28	NicholasB	yeah. was a little flaky on my phone.
2016-03-09 10:23:35	NicholasB	its all cleared up now however

2016-03-09 15:07:34	Moritz	Why not build computers for internet strangers? Much more rewardingâ¦ not really1

2016-03-09 16:30:50	@fsociety	Moritz - i guess it depends on the windows version. hahaha
2016-03-09 16:30:52	EricT	Is that a Homo-erotic desire or more of a Vapo-erotic desire?
2016-03-09 16:30:58	@fsociety	vapo-erotic
2016-03-09 16:31:02	EricT	lol

2016-03-09 16:36:37	Moritz	One of the filler questions is &quot;can you suck your own cock&quot;. I really like Stephan Frys answer. But then again i like everything he does.
2016-03-09 16:36:55	@fsociety	Would you let Fry have his way with you?
2016-03-09 16:37:00	@fsociety	I know you would
2016-03-09 16:37:02	@fsociety	lol
2016-03-09 16:37:03	EricT	what about this @F_s0c1ety

2016-03-09 16:41:02	@fsociety	termux looks like it could replace my juicessh application
2016-03-09 16:41:08	@fsociety	even does powerline fonts.. very nice
2016-03-09 16:43:26	@fsociety	zsh and grep my sms's... does this mean i can replace my whole phone environment with a command line

2016-03-09 17:19:36	EricT	I guess the Linus &amp; the Linux Kernel Devels should read this, LOL!
2016-03-09 18:34:06	NotDan	That was interesting actually. Makes a lot of sense
2016-03-09 18:34:41	Mathias	I think it was on Bad Voltage where they interviewed Greg KH. He talked about cultural differences and said something like &quot;for example Germans can be blunt&quot; in order to make his point.
2016-03-09 18:35:17	Mathias	So some already know.
2016-03-09 18:35:59	EricT	Cultural awareness is a skill
2016-03-09 18:37:09	Mathias	I guess it is easier to forget about when you are communicating via Mail.
2016-03-09 18:37:14	NotDan	Yeah
2016-03-09 18:37:24	NotDan	Plus a lot of context and tone is obviously lost in text
2016-03-09 18:41:38	Moritz	#systemau or the luddites might wanna mark 3rd April in their calendar. On that day Wallabag 2.0 will be released. Just tested the beta and it made great progress since v1.

2016-03-10 11:18:21	@fsociety	its nearly been 48 hours and one of my instances is still down
2016-03-10 11:18:22	NicholasB	why
2016-03-10 11:18:29	@fsociety	wont restore, wont boot, wont do anything

2016-03-10 11:19:02	@fsociety	yeah i know, sent support queries.. and they said a restore wasn't successful. which i didn't do at the time.  and they said try and restore - and none of my backup images will restore
2016-03-10 11:19:03	NicholasB	have you tried loading the snapshot on a new instance just to spin it up?
2016-03-10 11:19:34	@fsociety	no, because that will just cost me more money
2016-03-10 11:19:49	@fsociety	even if i add it and delete it will charge me for it
2016-03-10 11:20:12	NicholasB	only for like 15 cents though.
2016-03-10 11:21:26	@fsociety	is that all it is

2016-03-10 12:18:23	@fsociety	well that seemed to do it, but now i have to wait for the DNS to propogate to that new IP address
2016-03-10 12:18:30	@fsociety	waits impatiently
2016-03-10 12:18:37	@fsociety	only reason, is because of the SSL cert

2016-03-10 21:10:01	PaulGleeson	[18:34:13] I'm more of a vultr man
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NicholasB	[18:34:28] Still recording tonight though day is still enroute. Prob get started around 8 ish.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NicholasB	[18:36:55] Live stream will be announced.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[18:38:14] Cool, I hope I can make it.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NicholasB	[18:39:13] hahah. sorry if you cant. we will still be releasing on monday. but if its a nice easy edit i boost an early copy up her for you fanbois. :P
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[18:49:56] So, 8 ish means in ~ 1h? Damn time zones.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NicholasB	[18:52:14] yeah about that. even if we aren't up yet ill be playing tracks on the prestream
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[18:53:16] Thanks, man.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NottheOtherDan	[19:51:41] Hi all. Live stream will be up in a minute or s.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NottheOtherDan	[19:51:43] o
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NottheOtherDan	[19:51:45] .
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[19:59:11] Excuse my ignorance, but I didn't manage to find a link or something on your site. Is there a different place to look at(other than systemau.net.au)?
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NottheOtherDan	[20:01:49] systemau.net.au:8000/stream
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NottheOtherDan	[20:01:53] :)
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:02:55] Thanks
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:03:10] And sorry.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NicholasB	[20:04:35] never apolagise ;)
2016-03-10 21:10:01	NottheOtherDan	[20:04:45] No, Nick's sorry.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:06:09] It reminded me of work...There is always at least one dick asking.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:07:45] But now I got some music that tells me to go easy.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Moritz	[20:13:31] Telegram 3.6 is finally in Fdroid
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:20:04] Ever tested Signal?
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Moritz	[20:20:19] No.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Alex	[20:20:26] Yay for Signal! :)
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:20:52] It does not seem to be in Fdroid.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:21:02] Although it is FOSS.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Alex	[20:22:42] The Signal Devs don't like the FDroid model I think. And they use Google Services to send their messages AFAIK.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Alex	[20:23:26] Has been lots of discussions about that... unfortunately its unlikely to ever show up in FDroid.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:24:00] Usability wise it seems like a good app. It was easier to switch people to use Signal than with Telegram.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:25:11] That sucks. Maybe I should advertise Telegram instead of Signal.
2016-03-10 21:10:01	PaulGleeson	[20:26:21] I've got around 2 dozen people to jump to telegram
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:28:04] ð¤ Should I point people over to you in order to convince them?
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Moritz	[20:28:40] Just discovered that if you donate 13$ to Ubuntu Mate you become the &quot;unlucky patreon&quot;.

2016-03-10 21:10:01	PaulGleeson	[20:28:56] Do your people like gifs and stickers?
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:29:20] They like Whatsapp and Hike...
2016-03-10 21:10:01	PaulGleeson	[20:30:04] I haven't met anyone who actually likes whatsapp
2016-03-10 21:10:01	PaulGleeson	[20:30:34] People seem to tolerate it because all there friends have it
2016-03-10 21:10:01	Mathias	[20:32:10] They would never admit that.

2016-03-10 21:10:03	Moritz	[20:43:15] Telegram neeeds sticky posts. For the stream URL. Etc.
2016-03-10 21:10:03	EricT	[20:43:54] It sounds familiar, @mindtoker have I read that?
2016-03-10 21:10:03	NotDan	[20:44:21] One of the books from my Comp Sci course this semester; thought you may have crossed it in your tutor travels

2016-03-10 21:10:03	EricT	[20:45:54] best practise is King!
2016-03-10 21:10:03	NotDan	[20:46:00] For sure. The whole 3 / 5 practices debate

2016-03-10 21:10:03	NotDan	[20:46:38] I was going to take a Software Engineering major, but Security seems so interesting
2016-03-10 21:10:03	EricT	[20:47:31] Ground up is always best, as soon as you retro-fit or allow plug-ins &amp; dll shit gets compromised, always!

2016-03-11 05:28:41	Mathias	Thanks for the info. I am gonna look into it and may also give up Signal as soon as I found replacements for the other services-needing-apps.

2016-03-11 09:17:58	NicholasB	i only did it because the boss wanted me to draw a floor plan for the office and i can't install software and all the html5 apps wont work in ie,
2016-03-11 09:29:38	@fsociety	shudder

2016-03-11 09:35:39	NicholasB	we still use xp boss
2016-03-11 09:35:49	NicholasB	we still emulate pdp11s in some areas
2016-03-11 09:36:35	NicholasB	i used to have to input data in to a program that was written in swedish pascal in a terminal to a pdp11 emulator upstairs
2016-03-11 09:37:03	NicholasB	to upload to the other machine i had to mount usb drives to emulate the old washine machine 10mb platter disks
2016-03-11 09:37:34	NicholasB	for 4 year my only printer was a3 tractor feed
2016-03-11 09:43:06	@fsociety	security holes ahoy in your workplace
2016-03-11 09:43:23	@fsociety	i'd imagine it would be quite easy to hack your guys systems. haha
2016-03-11 09:45:13	Sean	Gotta love businesses that are keeping up with the times :)
2016-03-11 09:49:50	NicholasB	not the pdp11 that was isolated to about 20 computers in the same building and those pcs had no external network access
2016-03-11 09:50:07	NicholasB	the xp ones? ehhh. they are email and document editors
2016-03-11 09:50:15	NicholasB	not much to hack.
2016-03-11 09:51:42	@fsociety	so they are connected online
2016-03-11 09:54:34	NicholasB	? the xps
2016-03-11 10:01:40	Joe	Another day, another horror
2016-03-11 10:09:45	NicholasB	what is the horror today. also.. i'm agree with Jesse. I wish australia still had a tv license.
2016-03-11 10:10:00	NicholasB	:D
2016-03-11 10:14:53	@fsociety	australia needs to do a new referendum on free to air broadcast rules
2016-03-11 10:14:55	@fsociety	and quite desperately
2016-03-11 10:15:19	NicholasB	no we dont. it will just favour corporations
2016-03-11 10:15:28	@fsociety	we need HD
2016-03-11 10:15:36	@fsociety	on primary channels
2016-03-11 10:15:50	NicholasB	we can have hd on primary channels
2016-03-11 10:15:58	NicholasB	its up to the provider isnt it
2016-03-11 10:16:14	NicholasB	they have their bandwith and they choose to lower quality for more stations
2016-03-11 10:16:16	@fsociety	no it isn't
2016-03-11 10:16:28	@fsociety	the old 1992 broadcast law states that the primary channel must be in SD
2016-03-11 10:16:40	@fsociety	which is why all networks have HD as a secondary channel
2016-03-11 10:16:55	NicholasB	ahh/
2016-03-11 10:17:03	NicholasB	i really dont care.
2016-03-11 10:17:09	NicholasB	who watches tv?
2016-03-11 10:17:17	@fsociety	the broadcast law just needs to be updated.  and we have the bandwidth to do it.. we just need to put all main shows on the HD.  I only care for people who watch TV - and well the ABC
2016-03-11 10:17:18	NicholasB	i plug in my aerial once a yeat
2016-03-11 10:17:20	NicholasB	year
2016-03-11 10:17:25	@fsociety	I want my general ABC to be in HD
2016-03-11 10:17:26	NicholasB	for eurovision
2016-03-11 10:18:08	@fsociety	i think thats why I want, I don't care for the commercial networks.  But I'd love to see ABC broadcast its original content in HD
2016-03-11 10:18:11	@fsociety	at least online..
2016-03-11 10:18:53	NicholasB	i agree their online quality is bad
2016-03-11 10:18:59	NicholasB	id be happy with 720

2016-03-11 10:24:01	TristanJames	The only reason I still torrent Doctor Who is because iview is such shit quality.Â 
2016-03-11 10:24:21	TristanJames	But sometimes i play it on iview and turn the tv off just so abc get the numbers
2016-03-11 10:25:29	NicholasB	its weird i remeber micaleff saying on 774 how iview numbers dont count as ratings.
2016-03-11 10:25:37	NicholasB	at this point in time. \
2016-03-11 10:25:52	TristanJames	Maybe not in ratings, but they still keep track of views
2016-03-11 10:26:31	TristanJames	also, iview on chromecast is shit, always buffering
2016-03-11 10:27:44	NottheOtherDan	You don't listen to our podcast?
2016-03-11 10:28:07	NicholasB	no. he just pretends for the tapes
2016-03-11 10:29:49	TristanJames	i seem to remember you mentioning it. In fact, I think that's why I tried using iview on the chromecast, to see if my experience was the same
2016-03-11 10:30:18	AlanPope	Using Linux at work?!?!!!
2016-03-11 10:31:41	NicholasB	yeah. i only need email today. so logged in to web client.
2016-03-11 10:31:45	NicholasB	its great!
2016-03-11 10:31:53	NicholasB	using mobile internet
2016-03-11 10:31:57	NicholasB	can go anywhere!
2016-03-11 10:34:35	NottheOtherDan	Hey @popeydc, will we be seeing an UbuntuBudgie with 16.04?

2016-03-11 10:35:13	TristanJames	oops
2016-03-11 10:35:33	TristanJames	i get confused between the web app and the desktop app sometimes
2016-03-11 10:41:16	AlanPope	Nah. Way too late for that
2016-03-11 10:41:34	AlanPope	And would need buy in from ikey
2016-03-11 10:42:01	AlanPope	I don't think he really wants to make effort to make that happen
2016-03-11 10:42:15	AlanPope	Even if it gave him 10-100x users
2016-03-11 11:01:20	@fsociety	Regarding ABC that might change since because of the budget cuts they are concentrating on the online presence more rather than broadcast.  guess its cheaper to deal with more bandwidth on a digital sense rather than broadcast uhf waves.
2016-03-11 11:04:03	TristanJames	We might have to pay for the privilege thoughÂ 
2016-03-11 11:07:15	NicholasB	it shouldnt be cheper. The spectrum is allocated.
2016-03-11 11:08:17	NicholasB	which is why we should never have gotten rid of tv licences. and this whole fucking cutting the budget wouldnt be an issue.
2016-03-11 11:09:37	NicholasB	$120 a year for 15000000 premises gives the ABC 1.8 trillion a year
2016-03-11 11:10:18	TristanJames	Australia[edit]
2016-03-11 11:10:18	TristanJames	Radio licence fees were introduced in Australia in the 1920s to fund the first privately owned broadcasters, which were not permitted to sell advertising. With the formation of the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1932 the licence fees were used to fund ABC broadcasts while the privately owned stations were permitted to seek revenue from advertising and sponsorship. Television licence fees were also
2016-03-11 11:10:18	TristanJames	introduced in 1956 when the ABC began TV transmissions. All licence fees were abolished in 1974 by the Australian Labor Party government led by Gough Whitlam on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.[88] The ABC has since then been funded by government grants, now
2016-03-11 11:10:18	TristanJames	totalling around A$1.13 billion a year, and its own commercial activities (merchandising, overseas sale of programmes, etc.).
2016-03-11 11:10:18	TristanJames	 
2016-03-11 11:10:18	TristanJames	In 1964 the Australian Television Licence cost Â£6; the fine for not having a licence was Â£100. The licence was issued on a punch card.
2016-03-11 11:11:22	@fsociety	ooo. punch card
2016-03-11 11:11:29	@fsociety	can i get my licence on laser disc?
2016-03-11 11:13:25	@fsociety	talking about legislation i'm curious as to see what australia does about vapourises... clearly the tobacco industry is cracking the shits over it.. lost profits for them
2016-03-11 11:13:55	EricT	Puchcard readers for the toll roads, great idea!
2016-03-11 11:14:33	NicholasB	only some. Philip Morris owns some Vape brands in the USA
2016-03-11 11:15:22	EricT	More like the gov loosing taxes from smokes
2016-03-11 11:15:50	NicholasB	i wonder how much you'd have to grow for one person.
2016-03-11 11:16:09	NicholasB	i mean its illegal. but if one plant lasted a year.
2016-03-11 11:23:05	@fsociety	our government is greedy, how much do they need to tax cigarettes. lets face it - the lower class are the ones that smoke the most.
2016-03-11 11:25:05	NicholasB	its an easy tax. the people who complain are the ones who have no voice.
2016-03-11 11:28:49	TristanJames	I've seen a tobacco plant for sale at the lilydale herb farm
2016-03-11 11:29:04	NicholasB	really. they are pretty regulated.
2016-03-11 11:29:10	NicholasB	harsher fines than weed
2016-03-11 11:29:16	TristanJames	To be used as a 'weed killer'
2016-03-11 11:36:06	TristanJames	yeah, i was surprised when i saw it. it was about 3 years ago. they were also selling dandelion. it looked like a weed in a pot

2016-03-11 13:51:44	@fsociety	i've been looking at static page generators today that connect to a git repo

2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 20:40:52] https://sandilands.info/sgordon/multimedia-on-linux-command-line
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 21:41:27] Silly US election stuff:
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 21:41:27] https://imgur.com/gallery/3OKHx
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 21:43:49] I think Bernie is the candidate of choice in those pics
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 21:43:53] As it should be
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 21:44:21] Just saw the last image. Yeah.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 21:45:18] Is the fear of a Trump victory as strong in your country @lightonflux  as it is here?
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 21:47:36] I haven't noticed fear, just the sweet feeling this could be worse than GWB. In a horroble comedic sense.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 21:50:16] Just two pieces for you. First opinion from some journalist:
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 21:50:16] http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/opinion-why-donald-trump-stands-a-good-chance-of-winning-a-1081434.html
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 21:50:23] And then: http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/donald-trump-is-the-most-dangerous-man-in-the-world-a-1075060.html
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 21:55:12] I say &quot;here&quot; implying Australia, when I mean Perth. People rarely discuss politics here, but the prospect of that maniac being a genuine presidential candidate is stirring people up
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 21:55:45] Having said that, those opinion pieces seem very blunt in their analysis
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Alex	[2016-03-13 21:56:41] https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdHzlWDUUAAWIqm.jpg:large
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 22:06:22] Only the first is an opinion piece. The second one was written by three people. Or at least three people that worked on it are credited for it.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	AlanPope	[2016-03-13 22:08:29] Alsamixer helps
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:09:14] Creative Commons? No one could keep you from taking the audio only show and make a video out of it. The beard comments on FOSS talk.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 22:09:23] Trump literally advocated a war crime on a talk show
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:10:12] thats true. i could make it appear as ifg my beard is speaeking averyones opinions
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 22:11:59] Good article.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 22:14:18] It's 22mins long, and kinda falls apart at the very end but it's an interesting video analysing his antics
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 22:14:19] http://youtu.be/DnpO_RTSNmQ
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:20:06] I would watch it. Although it may depend on the chosen background for the green screen.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:20:35] stock footage of a cheese factory.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Moritz	[2016-03-13 22:21:54] I found it to be too much hit piece and not enough analysis and explaining and comparing to other people and events.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:21:57] The samples you shared looked very good. I only played around with audio recording and never wanted to film anything. Everybody just seems to say that Video production sucks under Linux.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:22:31] Alright, I am sold.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NotDan	[2016-03-13 22:23:02] Maybe they felt the very recounting of his comments and views would do that for them
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:26:30] this open studio broadcaster software is pretty sweet. Hopefully it will turn out okay. the only problem is because im producing and presenting my eyes might waver from the camera a bit.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:28:41] Can you put your monitor behind or next to the camera?
2016-03-14 00:36:28	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:29:28] dont need to. I can set it up like a tv studio and supeer impose videos on to the screen
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:31:16] I got to go for now. Looking forward to whatever you come up with.
2016-03-14 00:36:28	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:32:07] I just hope that Dan also has a beard. Couldn't trust whatever he says if he is beardless.
2016-03-14 00:36:29	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:32:28] <br><img id="6">
2016-03-14 00:36:29	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:34:42] Just for you mathias before you go to bed
2016-03-14 00:36:29	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:38:54] Gonna download it as soon as I am home.
2016-03-14 00:36:29	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:39:36] oh yeah. not bed. clearly its day where you are.
2016-03-14 00:36:29	NicholasB	[2016-03-13 22:39:38] stupid me
2016-03-14 00:36:29	Mathias	[2016-03-13 22:44:10] If I could just fast forward to it and skip the ten hours.

2016-03-14 14:29:32	Joe	[06:39:03] It's definitely happening
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Joe	[06:40:21] The event that is. Not the brain fart
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LewisCividin	[06:45:15] That looks like a top event @JoeRess
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Joe	[06:46:23] Hopefully
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:34:24] Morninall
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LachlanHolmes	[08:36:22] howdy
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:41:43] Morning.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:42:22] I'm tossing up if I should wake up or go back to sleep.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:42:44] *get up
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:45:16] You're right, it is pretty cool.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:45:51] And you just slept the whole ducking day. Get up.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:46:03] Haha.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:46:22] Oh really Android, you don't want me to type fucking.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:46:44] Oh yeah! Public holiday! Forgot about that (because I'm working anyway)
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:46:53] And now there is another word in my private dictionary.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:46:57] Anyway, I had to come in: no Internet at home
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:47:08] What is type fucking?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:47:09] What happened?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:48:20] My phone just corrected my spell error: It took &quot;fucking&quot; and made &quot;ducking&quot; out of it.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:48:40] They're building some townhouses down the street and that had a concrete pump working on Friday morning: One of the concrete trucks clipped our phone line and tore it out. No youtube and no steam make carlos something something
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:51:15] Ouch
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:51:28] yeah
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:51:38] You're one of those lucky workers without a corporate firewall that is also blocking most of the outgoing traffic.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:51:58] Telstra technician expected tomorrow
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:52:14] huh?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:52:27] You can game at work?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:52:38] .... maybe? ....
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:53:00] I think I need to go cook breaky. Corn beef hash for any hungry people who want to pop over.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:53:02] I won't install Steam here, but I can play Minecraft
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[08:53:16] Happy bfast Nick
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:54:51] I am even having trouble sending mails via Thunderbird. When I call the network guy he asks me to use the browser and log into the webinterface.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:55:08] He is not going to open another port...
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[08:55:58] We can't change our wallpaper
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:56:34] I don't know what ports steam is using but I guess companies would tend to block it.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:57:07] Yeah, I also do have a wonderful not changeable wallpaper.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[08:58:20] Are you working in front of customers?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[09:02:37] Nope. But it's a company wide thing. On XP I just edited the registry. Because for soem reason that wasn't locked. (Idiots) but win 7 is a different story
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[09:07:54] Isn't there a possibility to place a picture show onto the desktop?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[09:09:19] I just find that kind of everybody-should-use-my-background mentality hilarious.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LachlanHolmes	[09:09:43] Guys, What's the hot game right now on steam/linux?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LewisCividin	[09:10:06] superhot
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LachlanHolmes	[09:10:26] ive finished far cry primal and i need a new game to work on until the next big title comes out... ok superhot.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LewisCividin	[09:11:41] it's an indie, guy at work said it's fun as; I'm still playing pillers or enternity which is taking a while (hence the title I suppose lol)
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LewisCividin	[09:12:14] The devision looks pretty cool for a AAA title
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[09:12:21] yeah, but I'm the IT department
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[09:13:07] Don't know about hot (and it's not exactly new) but I've been playing FTL
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Mathias	[09:14:04] You lucky guy.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	PaulGleeson	[09:18:30] I'm actually tempted
2016-03-14 14:29:32	PaulGleeson	[09:19:16] I'm so sorry man, its a dangerous time sink
2016-03-14 14:29:32	Joe	[09:19:35] It's going to be a great night
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[09:19:49] Word! Also a rage machine
2016-03-14 14:29:32	PaulGleeson	[09:20:20] Yeah its a fair game
2016-03-14 14:29:32	PaulGleeson	[09:20:30] Its fun but completely on fair
2016-03-14 14:29:32	PaulGleeson	[09:20:38] Unfair*
2016-03-14 14:29:32	CarlosLopez	[09:20:59] fun fair?
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:24:43] podcast editing time!
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:24:52] though fuck me i had a scare.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:25:01] podcast hard drive is doing the click of death
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:25:57] wouldn't pick up first few times i plugged it in
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:26:00] o_O
2016-03-14 14:29:32	LachlanHolmes	[10:26:13] spideroak that shit ðÂ 
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:26:32] the issue is i record from a desk too usb. not on my pc.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	NicholasB	[10:26:45] so there is always a point where that drive has the only copy.
2016-03-14 14:29:32	EricT	[10:27:13] Yay! free BBQ at work for lunch!
2016-03-14 14:29:32	EricT	[10:27:28] Halal Sausages!

2016-03-14 14:29:32	EricT	[10:30:59] IKR,
