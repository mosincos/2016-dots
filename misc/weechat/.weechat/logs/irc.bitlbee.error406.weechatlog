2016-03-02 09:53:52	fsociety	so have you spoken to your brother lately
2016-03-02 09:54:03	fsociety	i'm curious as to his thoughts on sunday without me being in the room
2016-03-02 09:55:04	error406	THWAAARK GRRRNNNNN
2016-03-02 09:55:04	error406	hehe oinly bereifly, but yeah def liked having you round drummin!
2016-03-02 09:55:58	fsociety	excellent :)
2016-03-02 09:56:04	fsociety	glad to be of service to the family.. haha
2016-03-02 09:56:07	fsociety	how are you doing today
2016-03-02 09:58:01	error406	yeah good, just about finished all my work, couple of hours n I'll be moving back to unreal woo!
2016-03-02 09:58:01	error406	What about yerself? feeling a bit better than yesterday?
2016-03-02 09:58:08	fsociety	i did do a doozy on my back though.. not used to playing for that long.. and the kit in his house wasn't ergonomically set up for me properly.  but i did the best i can. hopefully some time next week another jam is planned
2016-03-02 09:58:50	fsociety	well i realised if i get that drive back, and i can use it temporarily - put in the rma (which has a 5 year warranty) and give you my old black back .. haha
2016-03-02 09:58:53	fsociety	should only take 2 weeks
2016-03-02 10:00:37	fsociety	how is ue4 going for you :)
2016-03-02 10:03:06	error406	hehe well that's better than having to buy a new one at least!
2016-03-02 10:03:25	fsociety	indeed
2016-03-02 10:03:40	fsociety	most likely i'll probably just keep rma'ing it over and over again if it has a 5-yr warranty
2016-03-02 10:03:40	fsociety	haha
2016-03-02 10:04:56	error406	and yeah going really well, learning heaps thsese days.. have custom characters in, can animate any other object in ways not usually possible in game engines, and generallly picking up heaps about the overall engine... have learned how to do menu systems, better lighting, and moving onto ai next!
2016-03-02 10:05:15	error406	lol FREE DRIVES FOREVER!!
2016-03-02 10:05:42	fsociety	wouldn't that be wonderful
2016-03-02 10:05:52	fsociety	i want to build your thing for linux just to check performance comparison
2016-03-02 10:06:00	fsociety	im looking out for the vulkan update for ue4 as well
2016-03-02 10:08:13	error406	hehe well you're welcome to grab a copy of a project and give it a go!
2016-03-02 10:11:33	fsociety	excellent
2016-03-02 10:11:45	fsociety	now to figure out how to compile under this linux distro.. i'll figure this out now
2016-03-02 10:12:24	error406	I'd be interested to also see if I can make a scene overload my 970 and then see how it runs on sli hehe
2016-03-02 10:12:41	error406	just for the fun of using your sli lol
2016-03-02 10:13:42	fsociety	yeah sure.. go for your life :)
2016-03-02 10:15:09	error406	I've got one scene with 80 guys in it and it's not hurting anything yet, I'll just keep duplicating peole til it hurts it heheh
2016-03-02 10:17:41	error406	wow just made it 320 guys and it's still having no problem.. granted they are the same guy doing the ssame movement tho
2016-03-02 10:17:59	fsociety	wait for the 4k braahh
2016-03-02 10:23:47	fsociety	ue4 compiling as we speak
2016-03-02 10:35:05	fsociety	do you have anywhere that i could download the probject files :)
2016-03-02 10:36:05	fsociety	just so i can compile the project when i get home really quickly.. rather than doing the whole here is a usb stick. blah, blah, blah.
2016-03-02 10:36:32	error406	aahh it'll be easier to just copy them... the baptcare foilder is 16gb (not that big on complile tho hehe)
2016-03-02 10:37:04	error406	I think the most I could get it down tro woulbe be 1-2gb
2016-03-02 10:37:33	fsociety	ahh that large hey
2016-03-02 10:37:43	fsociety	i'll bring my trusty usb 3 usbstick then
2016-03-02 10:37:53	fsociety	so damn quick, cant go back to crappy ones
2016-03-02 10:38:25	error406	hehe cool, yyean dan and I talked about saring projects online then quickly realised that was kinda out of the question, especially with his slow internets
2016-03-02 10:40:59	fsociety	haha.. carrier pidgin for dan
2016-03-02 10:41:53	error406	lol depending how much a pidgeon can carry, that might be faster jfor a lot of australians haha

2016-03-02 10:42:35	fsociety	raaahhhhh

2016-03-02 11:30:39	fsociety	can do some pretty cool things with it, javascript is so damn easy.

2016-03-02 11:33:53	fsociety	getting there slowly
2016-03-02 11:33:54	fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/Zvsey.png
2016-03-02 11:34:25	fsociety	had to compile certain libraries locally and setup a custom environmental path so it wouldn't conflict my "actual" installed libraries
2016-03-02 11:34:31	fsociety	ue4 is really particular with what it wants
2016-03-02 11:45:48	fsociety	so i've been on the vaporizer since friday

2016-03-02 12:01:38	fsociety	there are a few things i need to actually do, but all the libraries seem to be talking to each other alright.. now to compile the ide
2016-03-02 12:02:59	fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/giEzp.png
2016-03-02 12:03:04	fsociety	sorry about that incomplete url
2016-03-02 12:09:05	fsociety	ahh now the real compiling starts.. its taking forever now
2016-03-02 12:09:06	fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/OCpV3.png
2016-03-02 13:15:35	error406	oh lol so it hadn't really started before? how long does it take to compile??
2016-03-02 13:21:49	fsociety	let me check to see where it is at
2016-03-02 13:21:57	fsociety	forever
2016-03-02 13:22:01	fsociety	its at 48/788

2016-03-02 13:23:06	fsociety	https://u.teknik.io/uD9m1.png
2016-03-02 13:23:11	fsociety	and its pushing the machine
2016-03-02 13:23:41	fsociety	from what i can tell though it seems to be using the gpu to do most of the compiling
2016-03-02 13:23:44	fsociety	thats pretty cool
2016-03-02 13:24:25	error406	yeah they're pretty good at utilising the graphics hardware, good to see someone is doing things properly hehe
2016-03-02 13:24:40	fsociety	cause i checked the cpu temp and its only sitting at 39 degrees
2016-03-02 13:24:48	fsociety	hmm.. time to check gpu temp
2016-03-02 13:25:22	fsociety	up to using 6gb at the moment to compile
2016-03-02 13:25:55	error406	so it's using both cards, or u just mean ram?
2016-03-02 13:30:23	fsociety	ram
2016-03-02 13:55:22	 - 	irc: disconnected from server
