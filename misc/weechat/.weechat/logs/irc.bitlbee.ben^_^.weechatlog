2016-03-07 17:43:27	Ben^_^	Oh denis you can't steam me on weekends, too many DOS games!
2016-03-07 17:43:45	Ben^_^	I can't put steam on my 120mhz Pentium! D:
2016-03-07 17:46:49	fsociety	hahaha..... NOT ENOUGH DOS AND HIMEM.SYS
2016-03-07 17:47:32	Ben^_^	Haha oh man I had to throw some more stuff from my AUTOEXEC.BAT into the upper memory block the other day
2016-03-07 17:47:39	Ben^_^	NEED MORE CONVENTIONAL MEMORY FOR GAMES
2016-03-07 17:47:46	Ben^_^	WHO NEEDS MOUSE DRIVERS!?
2016-03-07 18:12:43	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 18:12:50	Ben^_^	Did you ever see 8088mph?
2016-03-07 18:12:55	Ben^_^	You should fucking watch that man
2016-03-07 18:13:11	Ben^_^	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXx3orN35Y
2016-03-07 18:13:34	Ben^_^	Oh wait final version here sorry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNRO7lno_DM&feature=iv&src_vid=yHXx3orN35Y&annotation_id=annotation_1901077497
2016-03-07 18:14:33	Ben^_^	Haha not yet I have so much music to catch up on :(
2016-03-07 18:16:25	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 18:16:32	Ben^_^	Already I want to see the sheet music for it
2016-03-07 18:18:10	Ben^_^	Haha man
2016-03-07 18:18:11	Ben^_^	His voice is so identifiable
2016-03-07 18:18:32	Ben^_^	Almost feels like Cilice got a whole new band rather than textures getting a new singer haha
2016-03-07 18:19:12	Ben^_^	Yeah it is haha
2016-03-07 18:19:30	Ben^_^	trixter actually contacted me about doing some graphic work for his wife's book a while ago
2016-03-07 18:19:37	Ben^_^	And I was like are you kidding you're my hero haha
2016-03-07 18:22:03	Ben^_^	He actually writes it on his site
2016-03-07 18:22:13	Ben^_^	It's pretty intense reading
2016-03-07 18:23:29	Ben^_^	http://www.reenigne.org/blog/1k-colours-on-cga-how-its-done/
2016-03-07 18:23:41	Ben^_^	http://8088mph.blogspot.com.au/2015/04/cga-in-1024-colors-new-mode-illustrated.html
2016-03-07 18:24:17	Ben^_^	https://scalibq.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/8088-mph-sprites-where-were-going-we-dont-need-sprites/
2016-03-07 18:24:20	Ben^_^	(there's a lot haha)
2016-03-07 18:24:42	Ben^_^	https://scalibq.wordpress.com/2015/04/23/8088-mph-the-polygons/
2016-03-07 18:25:14	Ben^_^	This page has a link to a bunch of other stuff too: http://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/04/07/8088-mph-we-break-all-your-emulators/
2016-03-07 18:25:56	Ben^_^	Yeah, it's basically the best demo you can imagine when you consider the fucking hardware they're using
2016-03-07 18:26:51	Ben^_^	There's no way I thought those things could do any of the stuff in that demo
2016-03-07 18:27:38	Ben^_^	I mean I thought CGA was hackable to... 16 colours haha
2016-03-07 18:28:20	Ben^_^	yep, and hacking that
2016-03-07 18:28:41	Ben^_^	That's exactly right.
2016-03-07 18:30:18	Ben^_^	Haha I think it's actually sound recording of him?
2016-03-07 18:30:26	Ben^_^	I drew a cat but it doesn't look like cupcake!
2016-03-07 18:30:34	Ben^_^	I don't even know my own game haha
2016-03-07 18:31:43	Ben^_^	Also dude what's your aspect ratio?
2016-03-07 18:33:10	Ben^_^	Oh what the hell Dean
2016-03-07 18:33:13	Ben^_^	That's not even sensible haha
2016-03-07 18:33:24	Ben^_^	HOW MUCH PILLARBOXING DO YOU DO
2016-03-07 18:33:46	Ben^_^	Haha of course
2016-03-07 18:34:13	Ben^_^	lollll haha
2016-03-07 18:34:51	Ben^_^	nope
2016-03-07 18:34:59	Ben^_^	Ain't gonna happen for a while, I don't think
2016-03-07 18:35:37	Ben^_^	afaik the last Unity upgrade broke a ton of shit
2016-03-07 18:35:53	Ben^_^	I know Ragnar was saying how hard a time they had fixing Dreamfall Chapters after the upgrade
2016-03-07 18:36:00	Ben^_^	So that kinda scared Dave off a bit
2016-03-07 18:37:01	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 18:37:05	Ben^_^	But also
2016-03-07 18:37:15	Ben^_^	Dave and Grundi aren't super coders, they're writers and designers
2016-03-07 18:37:24	Ben^_^	AGS is 100% designed to support writers and designers more than coders
2016-03-07 18:37:36	Ben^_^	So they're in a comfortable workspace which doesn't require you to learn coding
2016-03-07 18:37:50	Ben^_^	Yeah, but you have to make it work with 2D :)
2016-03-07 18:38:01	Ben^_^	In the same neat way AGS does
2016-03-07 18:38:21	Ben^_^	And also allow for having an overlay where a coder has built in "look" and "turn" and stuff functions
2016-03-07 18:38:38	Ben^_^	Because what they really want is directorial tools, not a coding language.
2016-03-07 18:38:55	Ben^_^	Dave had trouble getting characters to turn around in Unity haha
2016-03-07 18:39:27	Ben^_^	Yeah
2016-03-07 18:39:39	Ben^_^	Honestly I really doubt they'll change any time soon UNTIL someone does all the heavy lifting for them.
2016-03-07 18:39:41	Ben^_^	Dude
2016-03-07 18:39:48	Ben^_^	I had to code the commentary buttons in Shardlight
2016-03-07 18:39:57	Ben^_^	Because Francisco couldn't get mouseover highlights to work
2016-03-07 18:40:18	Ben^_^	That's the level of coder I'm talking about man
2016-03-07 18:40:21	Ben^_^	You don't really understand haha
2016-03-07 18:40:28	Ben^_^	He is really not a coder at all
2016-03-07 18:40:35	Ben^_^	Not a problem solving one
2016-03-07 18:40:48	Ben^_^	Exactly.
2016-03-07 18:40:59	Ben^_^	That stuff in the Shardlight demo with drawing with chalk and stuff?
2016-03-07 18:41:02	Ben^_^	I coded and designed that
2016-03-07 18:41:14	Ben^_^	No way could he code that if you gave him a week to do it
2016-03-07 18:41:20	Ben^_^	Yeah
2016-03-07 18:41:31	Ben^_^	His code for walking pedestrians around is over 1000 lines
2016-03-07 18:41:35	Ben^_^	Because it's spaghetti shit
2016-03-07 18:43:34	Ben^_^	I wonder how Janet would deal with that
2016-03-07 18:43:40	Ben^_^	She's the real person you'd have to get it past
2016-03-07 18:43:52	Ben^_^	She's the one that actually understands that stuff, yeah
2016-03-07 18:43:56	Ben^_^	Grundi doesn't know what an array is
2016-03-07 18:44:04	Ben^_^	I tried explaining to him once and it just bounced off
2016-03-07 18:44:07	Ben^_^	I'm serious dude haha
2016-03-07 18:44:17	Ben^_^	He's a designer and writer
2016-03-07 18:44:20	Ben^_^	He ain't a coder
2016-03-07 18:44:33	Ben^_^	Just not the extent haha
2016-03-07 18:44:43	Ben^_^	Right
2016-03-07 18:44:44	Ben^_^	Doesn't use pointers
2016-03-07 18:44:49	Ben^_^	Doesn't use enumerated types
2016-03-07 18:44:52	Ben^_^	No structs
2016-03-07 18:45:02	Ben^_^	It's literally just setting variables.
2016-03-07 18:45:19	Ben^_^	Haha I fucking hated Global Messages and all that awful shit
2016-03-07 18:45:37	Ben^_^	Setting variable 32 YEAH GREAT THAT'S HELPFUL
2016-03-07 18:46:06	Ben^_^	Well, that could be good thing or bad
2016-03-07 18:46:39	Ben^_^	oof
2016-03-07 18:47:09	Ben^_^	Sounds like it, yeah.
2016-03-07 18:47:24	Ben^_^	I have trouble working under those limitations man haha
2016-03-07 18:47:37	Ben^_^	Latest game I'm working on is at 640x360 res anyway
2016-03-07 18:48:11	Ben^_^	One day I wanna work with an engine with shaders so I can do better versions of this http://i.imgur.com/jTqzLKl.gifv
2016-03-07 18:50:12	Ben^_^	Honestly
2016-03-07 18:50:16	Ben^_^	I think the best solution would be
2016-03-07 18:50:26	Ben^_^	Write a whole new engine that's compatible with the editor
2016-03-07 18:50:35	Ben^_^	But obviously that's a LOT of work
2016-03-07 18:50:46	Ben^_^	There's just too much legacy shit weighing it down
2016-03-07 18:53:07	Ben^_^	Doesn't surprise me tbh
2016-03-07 18:53:41	Ben^_^	Well
2016-03-07 18:53:45	Ben^_^	I mean
2016-03-07 18:54:09	Ben^_^	Unreal engine was designed by people who make engines for games and have been doing so for ages.
2016-03-07 18:54:18	Ben^_^	Unity is a new kid on the block
2016-03-07 18:54:34	Ben^_^	That was originally designed with browser integration as the big feature :P
2016-03-07 18:54:41	Ben^_^	No wonder it has problems
2016-03-07 18:55:04	Ben^_^	Yeah, I remember playing stuff made in it and thinking it was fucking horrible
2016-03-07 18:55:12	Ben^_^	And stopped paying attention for years until I played uh
2016-03-07 18:55:18	Ben^_^	Rochard
2016-03-07 18:55:23	Ben^_^	Oh man
2016-03-07 18:55:28	Ben^_^	Fucking Visionaire haha
2016-03-07 18:55:36	Ben^_^	I played through Paradigm on the weekend
2016-03-07 18:55:43	Ben^_^	Great game, looking forward to seeing it finished
2016-03-07 18:55:58	Ben^_^	There's a couple of black metal gags in there that cracked me the fuck up haha
2016-03-07 18:56:02	Ben^_^	But ugh, so many bugs.
2016-03-07 18:56:18	Ben^_^	And I was talking to Jacob at a backyard dev gathering in Perth and he was tlaking about stuff
2016-03-07 18:56:21	Ben^_^	And he's worse man
2016-03-07 18:56:42	Ben^_^	He didn't know what I meant by "integer variable" when I was trying to explain arrays to him
2016-03-07 18:56:53	Ben^_^	These engines are designed for people who have NEVER coded
2016-03-07 18:56:54	Ben^_^	Seriously
2016-03-07 18:57:05	Ben^_^	And people write 20 lines of code and feel really proud of it
2016-03-07 18:57:27	Ben^_^	Not realizing how extremely high level the language they're using is, and how much work is done for them.
2016-03-07 18:57:34	Ben^_^	The worst thing is there ARE good coders
2016-03-07 18:57:37	Ben^_^	But
2016-03-07 18:57:40	Ben^_^	1. They're all weird
2016-03-07 18:57:44	Ben^_^	2. They're all unreliable
2016-03-07 18:57:51	Ben^_^	3. They never fucking finish what they start
2016-03-07 18:58:25	Ben^_^	I'm better off working with cunts who don't even know what a fucking array is just because at least the projects get fucking finished.
2016-03-07 18:58:52	Ben^_^	Yeah
2016-03-07 18:58:55	Ben^_^	I mean so are artists.
2016-03-07 18:59:04	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 18:59:11	Ben^_^	And like
2016-03-07 18:59:19	Ben^_^	I can code decent in AGS
2016-03-07 18:59:26	Ben^_^	Not amazing or anything, but I can fake my way through shit
2016-03-07 18:59:53	Ben^_^	But I am full time drawing, trying to produce art an animation to the same scale as what Sierra needed whole teams for
2016-03-07 19:00:09	Ben^_^	So to get shit done I can't spend much time coding
2016-03-07 19:00:17	Ben^_^	It has, yeah
2016-03-07 19:00:24	Ben^_^	I cheat my way through a lot
2016-03-07 19:00:39	Ben^_^	But it's still a very big workload, too big to allow much time to experiment with code and stuff haha
2016-03-07 19:01:55	Ben^_^	Yeah
2016-03-07 19:02:04	Ben^_^	It's crazy how much fucking work nobody did back then :P
2016-03-07 19:02:21	Ben^_^	Rotoscoped bullshit
2016-03-07 19:03:52	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 19:04:01	Ben^_^	I do like SCI games for what they are, yeah
2016-03-07 19:04:07	Ben^_^	But I mean
2016-03-07 19:04:16	Ben^_^	Aren't you sick of open world survival crafting sims too?
2016-03-07 19:04:19	Ben^_^	I mean bleh
2016-03-07 19:04:38	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 19:04:41	Ben^_^	Well that's the thing
2016-03-07 19:04:53	Ben^_^	It's easy to learn, does most of the work for you, and it's gotten popular
2016-03-07 19:04:58	Ben^_^	You're gonna see lots more of it
2016-03-07 19:05:21	Ben^_^	Yeah dunno man
2016-03-07 19:06:50	Ben^_^	Yeah
2016-03-07 19:06:57	Ben^_^	Our porting process is a nightmare haha
2016-03-07 19:07:25	Ben^_^	Haha yeah
2016-03-07 19:09:04	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 19:09:14	Ben^_^	The other thing to remember about engine etc
2016-03-07 19:09:32	Ben^_^	Is that there's not super amounts of time for experimenting when you're already trying to get a game finished
2016-03-07 19:09:36	Ben^_^	And when it's your only source of income haha
2016-03-07 19:09:46	Ben^_^	Like when I had a day job I used to fuck around with stuff alllll the time
2016-03-07 19:09:51	Ben^_^	Making new experiments and things
2016-03-07 19:10:02	Ben^_^	Now I'm like "Gotta work through this spreadsheet of assets" heh
2016-03-07 19:10:26	Ben^_^	Nice
2016-03-07 19:11:59	Ben^_^	It is now, yeah.
2016-03-07 19:12:05	Ben^_^	The update broke it pretty convincingly.
2016-03-07 19:12:18	Ben^_^	I was actually working with James on an experimental 3D game
2016-03-07 19:12:26	Ben^_^	Was going well until unity update
2016-03-07 19:12:54	Ben^_^	I think James is the guy who will push WEG forward if he stick around
2016-03-07 19:13:05	Ben^_^	I actually don't know, haven't investigated
2016-03-07 19:13:17	Ben^_^	James hasn't been around much lately.
2016-03-07 19:13:51	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 19:15:08	Ben^_^	Hehe nice, although I'm probably gonna be in NYC around May/June
2016-03-07 19:15:28	Ben^_^	Haha
2016-03-07 19:16:31	Ben^_^	Haha there's prog references I hope you get
2016-03-07 19:16:46	Ben^_^	Okay haha
2016-03-07 19:16:50	 - 	irc: disconnected from server

2016-03-08 14:29:57	Ben^_^	Haha Deanis
2016-03-08 14:30:08	Ben^_^	I am currently working through some design stuff with Francisco

2016-03-08 14:30:56	fsociety	DOS FONTS
2016-03-08 14:31:02	fsociety	lol
2016-03-08 14:31:07	Ben^_^	Haha
