2016-04-22 21:13:30	fs0ciety	hi guys wondering what is the easiest way to give omv webgui a non standard url
2016-04-22 21:14:14	+subzero79	fs0ciety, ?
2016-04-22 21:15:56	fs0ciety	well i installed gogs via a container, and it bloody indexed the url i was using
2016-04-22 21:16:35	fs0ciety	i guess i could block ip addresses
2016-04-22 21:18:24	+subzero79	what do you mean? no like you fs0ciety.com url has omv login page?
2016-04-22 21:18:36	fs0ciety	yeah
2016-04-22 21:18:40	fs0ciety	as an example
2016-04-22 21:19:45	+subzero79	use a proxy pass an sent requirements to that url to none
2016-04-22 21:20:03	+subzero79	assign a hard to guess prefix
2016-04-22 21:20:06	fs0ciety	so reverse proxy
2016-04-22 21:20:35	+subzero79	well....if they reach you by ip is pretty much the same
2016-04-22 21:20:54	+subzero79	anyway i wouln't leave omv login open to WAN side
2016-04-22 21:21:09	fs0ciety	yeah, im trying to figure out how to make it just localhost
2016-04-22 21:21:16	+subzero79	you can use a SOCKS or openvpn
2016-04-22 21:21:30	fs0ciety	i'd just ssh tunnel :)
2016-04-22 21:22:46	+subzero79	SOCKS yes of course
2016-04-22 21:23:09	fs0ciety	would i have to manually edit the nginx conf
2016-04-22 21:23:09	+subzero79	always....with keys also, no password and use another port not 22
2016-04-22 21:23:25	fs0ciety	i always use a non standard port on ssh :) and use keys also
2016-04-22 21:23:35	+subzero79	no, omv accepts the listen [::]:80 directive in sites-enabled
2016-04-22 21:23:51	+subzero79	so you place server block in that folder
2016-04-22 21:23:55	fs0ciety	i only have it on 443
2016-04-22 21:24:05	fs0ciety	port 80 is blocked by my isp
2016-04-22 21:24:12	+subzero79	you have to try, but i guess is the same
2016-04-22 21:24:24	fs0ciety	oki
2016-04-22 21:24:34	+subzero79	i run like 10 proxy pass in port 80 just using sites-enabled
2016-04-22 21:24:44	+subzero79	for local lan of course
2016-04-22 21:30:00		[21:24]
2016-04-22 21:35:02	fs0ciety	done .. cheers for that subzero79
