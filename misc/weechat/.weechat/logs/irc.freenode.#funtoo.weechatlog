2016-01-21 06:00:17	@angry_vincent	but kdenlive built without it

2016-01-21 06:03:33	kensington	before i've always seen the fault of the crash is frei0r being available
2016-01-21 06:04:04	kensington	maybe an automatic in mlt, no way to know without the backtrace ;0

2016-01-21 16:24:11	damex	jwpierce3, why don't you use fstab?

2016-01-21 16:41:32	jwpierce3	damex, yeah that is the problem: Under NFSv3 (type nfs) the _netdev option will tell the system to wait to mount until the network is available. With a type of nfs4 this option is ignored, but can be used with mount -O _netdev in scripts later. Currently Ubuntu Server does not come with the scripts needed to auto-mount nfs4 entries in /etc/fstab after the network is up.
2016-01-21 16:45:34	damex	jwpierce3, ubuntu server?

2016-01-22 05:08:12	palo	how to find out my profile on funtoo ? eselect profile show does not work,
2016-01-22 05:08:14	palo	it says
2016-01-22 05:08:28	palo	ah epro is a root command
2016-01-22 05:08:34	@angry_vincent	epro list

2016-01-22 05:10:54	palo	the profile in funtoo is different from the profiles in gentoo right?
2016-01-22 05:11:08	palo	in gentoo a profile is something like gentoo-2012 or something right?
2016-01-22 05:11:37	@angry_vincent	yes, its different
2016-01-22 05:11:57	palo	Ok, than here is my problem
2016-01-22 05:13:01	palo	I have (-mmx) as compile flags (for emerge -v -p mlt) but in my makefile I configured mmx to be one of my CPU_FLAGS_X86
2016-01-22 05:13:23	palo	in #gentoo-dev-help, they said this means some of my profiles is masking that flag.
2016-01-22 05:13:39	palo	how to find out which one? grep on the files?
2016-01-22 05:13:44	@angry_vincent	this is weird
2016-01-22 05:13:58	@angry_vincent	mmx is default enabled on all (almost) files
2016-01-22 05:14:18	@angry_vincent	ehr, profiles, not files
2016-01-22 05:14:25	@angry_vincent	palo: show epro list
2016-01-22 05:15:11	palo	angry_vincent: http://pastebin.com/k6tmG2xm
2016-01-22 05:16:41	@angry_vincent	palo: epro show subarch
2016-01-22 05:16:49	palo	don't have a subarch
2016-01-22 05:16:52	palo	its empty
2016-01-22 05:17:38	@angry_vincent	ok, not sure why it's empty but you need to specify one
2016-01-22 05:17:56	palo	angry_vincent: ok,
2016-01-22 05:18:15	palo	I'll do and see if the problem still exists.
2016-01-22 05:19:16	@angry_vincent	palo: http://www.funtoo.org/Subarches
2016-01-22 05:20:07	palo	i have a core2_64
2016-01-22 05:21:33	@angry_vincent	epro subarch core2_64
2016-01-22 05:21:36	palo	so what about the CPU_FLAGS_X86 variable in the make.conf, could I remove it?
2016-01-22 05:21:39	@angry_vincent	shoudl do the thing
2016-01-22 05:21:49	@angry_vincent	yes, you can remove
2016-01-22 05:21:54	@angry_vincent	see a table for core2_64
2016-01-22 05:22:07	@angry_vincent	in wiki
2016-01-22 05:22:18	@angry_vincent	unless you want hand-crafted setting
2016-01-22 05:22:43	@angry_vincent	http://www.funtoo.org/Core2_64
2016-01-22 05:22:55	@angry_vincent	CPU_FLAGS (see CPU_FLAGS for more info)mmx mmxext sse sse2 sse3 ssse3
2016-01-22 05:23:12	palo	(same I have in my make.conf ^^)
2016-01-22 05:23:25	@angry_vincent	okey
2016-01-22 05:23:42	@angry_vincent	then setting subarch by epro shoudl be sufficient
2016-01-22 05:23:51	@angry_vincent	for mmx USE to appear
2016-01-22 05:24:11	palo	nice
2016-01-22 05:24:24	palo	let's see if emerge -v -p mlt works
2016-01-22 05:24:52	palo	hmm still (-mmx)
2016-01-22 05:25:19	@angry_vincent	grep -r mmx /etc/portage/
2016-01-22 05:26:33	palo	just in the make.conf (removing it now)
2016-01-22 05:27:01	palo	nope still (-mmx)
2016-01-22 05:27:04	@angry_vincent	then it will not fix
2016-01-22 05:28:33	@angry_vincent	did you install from scratch or updated very old box or did live migration from gentoo to funtoo (or alike)

2016-01-22 05:28:53	palo	installed from scratch
2016-01-22 05:29:18	palo	i grepped in /usr/portage/profile, could find this ./arch/amd64/use.mask:-mmx
2016-01-22 05:29:23	palo	./arch/amd64/use.mask:-cpu_flags_x86_mmx
2016-01-22 05:29:58	@angry_vincent	ok, that means that it should be enabled and not disabled
2016-01-22 05:30:09	@angry_vincent	what stage did you use and how did you install?
2016-01-22 05:30:27	@angry_vincent	becuase missing subarch is something unusual
2016-01-22 05:30:46	palo	I installed around 1 1/2 years ago
2016-01-22 05:31:30	palo	my build is current
2016-01-22 05:31:43	@angry_vincent	then you trying to update from 1 1/2 year or kept box updated regularly?
2016-01-22 05:31:56	palo	now
2016-01-22 05:32:00	palo	nooooo :D
2016-01-22 05:32:00	palo	lol
2016-01-22 05:32:06	@angry_vincent	what is now?

2016-01-22 05:32:38	@angry_vincent	okey
2016-01-22 05:32:57	@angry_vincent	then disappearing of subarch need a research on your side
2016-01-22 05:33:10	@angry_vincent	what you did, etc
2016-01-22 05:33:12	@angry_vincent	logs
2016-01-22 05:33:20	@angry_vincent	emerge logs
2016-01-22 05:33:41	@angry_vincent	it's hard to track
2016-01-22 05:33:56	@angry_vincent	but what you can try is to dump portage tree
2016-01-22 05:34:00	palo	I can't remember anything about setting subarch in the first place, back than I had to put the CPU_FLAGS_X86 in the USE variable.
2016-01-22 05:34:05	@angry_vincent	and sync from scratch
2016-01-22 05:34:31	@angry_vincent	mv /usr/portage /ur/portage.old
2016-01-22 05:34:37	@angry_vincent	emerge --sync

2016-01-22 05:38:06	palo	Well they marked it stable a while ago.
2016-01-22 05:38:10	palo	but ok.
2016-01-22 05:38:14	@angry_vincent	palo: idea is to remove portage tree, not partitions
2016-01-22 05:38:31	@angry_vincent	unless your portage tree is in partition
2016-01-22 05:39:04	palo	It is

2016-01-22 05:48:03	palo	I experianced that in NixOS a while ago, and liked it a lot. But NixOS has other problems.
2016-01-22 05:48:14	maraku	you'll have to ask someone with more experience working with lvm snapshots

2016-01-22 06:23:53	mitzip	well it's been in gentoo and so I figured there might be a problem we ran into here... if it's just a matter of man power to bump it... I'll give it a shot this weekend
2016-01-22 06:24:40	xemacs	also debian
2016-01-22 06:25:49	@angry_vincent	a prblem is that it has incompatible ABI changes
2016-01-22 06:25:59	mitzip	that's what I was thinking
2016-01-22 06:26:05	@angry_vincent	no way to dig into it and wste rest of year
2016-01-22 06:26:21	@angry_vincent	update to it will come eventually
2016-01-22 06:26:32	@angry_vincent	but it's not ready
2016-01-22 06:27:28	@angry_vincent	stable compiler is the n option
2016-01-22 06:27:44	mitzip	angry_vincent: danke for the clarification
2016-01-22 06:27:48	mitzip	n option?
2016-01-22 06:27:53	@angry_vincent	an option
2016-01-22 06:29:24	@angry_vincent	mitzip: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=566328 for a reflection
2016-01-22 06:32:20	mitzip	angry_vincent: excellent, thanks... checking it out
2016-01-22 06:32:43	@angry_vincent	problem is rather complex
2016-01-22 06:32:47	@angry_vincent	very
2016-01-22 06:33:06	@angry_vincent	assuming the way gentoo treating toolchain
2016-01-22 06:33:22	@angry_vincent	and that fixes are workarounds
2016-01-22 06:34:19	Digit	my answers looked spammy ?_?  no forum account for me.  just wanted to post a quick thread before i fell asleep

2016-01-24 10:38:04	lambd0x	znac: I'm gonna try the other mtp implementations suggested in gentoo wiki. Yes, for I emerged libmtp...its a mtpfs dependencie
2016-01-24 10:38:24	znac	gotcha

2016-01-24 10:40:04	lambd0x	Ok, I'll :)

2016-01-24 10:44:48	lambd0x	znac: Agreed, everytime I don't get my problems fixed in here I get it there. Or as a last resource really the Funtoo Forum.
2016-01-24 10:47:00	znac	great
2016-01-24 10:48:54	znac	competency :)
2016-01-24 10:49:22	znac	im very excited for my this first gentoo install
2016-01-24 10:49:27	znac	i take it you've used both?
2016-01-24 10:52:57	lambd0x	znac: Nops, before this OS I used Ubuntu and OpenBSD. But a friend of mine recommended Funtoo for he was using it a quite long time and it does have some BSD heritage.
2016-01-24 10:54:36	lambd0x	But as I learned, in fact Funtoo is a overlay of Gentoo and all Gentoo's packages Funtoo has and vice-versa. Daily Funtoo syncs from Gentoo somethings and so does Funtoo
2016-01-24 10:56:02	lambd0x	By the way... I installed Funtoo 6 days ago :)
2016-01-24 10:56:17	znac	interesting!
2016-01-24 10:56:46	znac	i really like OpenBSD and used it for some time
2016-01-24 10:56:51	znac	ubuntu is a different story :P
2016-01-24 10:57:40	znac	so yeah, from what i've gathered, funtoo is as you've described... seems interesting! couldn't decide which one to try first, so installing both in VMs :)
2016-01-24 10:58:04	znac	so what's the BSD heritage you've found? the init system?
2016-01-24 10:58:21	artois	the package manager is inspired by freebsd's
2016-01-24 10:59:15	lambd0x	znac: Exactly and the idea of maintaining everything in a tree repository and compiling everything from source.
2016-01-24 11:00:47	znac	artois: very nice. another quality system with a great package manager
2016-01-24 11:01:02	lambd0x	By the way... Funtoo is a evolved version of Gentoo, both were created by Daniel Robbins. But the younger of both is Funtoo.
2016-01-24 11:01:14	lambd0x	portage :)
2016-01-24 11:01:39	znac	i see.
2016-01-24 11:01:41	znac	yes
2016-01-24 11:02:32	lambd0x	yeah... when I first used linux 6 months ago apt-get for me was everything but then a professor suggested installing some BSD and portage really rocks way better.
2016-01-24 11:04:58	znac	haha apt... those were the days.
2016-01-24 11:05:18	lambd0x	znac: kkk. Did you start with it too?
2016-01-24 11:05:19	artois	prof of what?
2016-01-24 11:06:19	lambd0x	artois: Prof of Computer Networks :)

2016-01-24 12:33:32	dangergrrl	you know the guy who was my best friend in high school gets like $100/hr full time as a DBA and failed college algebra twice so i am not sure how important having a lot of math is for real work in IT
2016-01-24 12:33:43	dangergrrl	i mean perhaps if you are an academic
2016-01-24 12:34:44	artois	the piece of paper is the important part
2016-01-24 12:34:46	dangergrrl	he gets more than i ever did and i was doing unix internals specializing in fault tolerant and massively parallel systems
2016-01-24 12:34:56	artois	not how you got it, or what place you were in graduating
2016-01-24 12:35:13	artois	also more than any piece of paper, one's hustle is the most important
2016-01-24 12:35:23	artois	the more content you are at fleecing people, the better you'll do
2016-01-24 12:35:42	artois	being rich is not about being smart or useful
2016-01-24 12:35:45	dangergrrl	yes, the piece of paper is important i found out when i tried to get a full time job that i could not get hired to do the same job i was doing as a contractor because i have no masters degree
2016-01-24 12:35:49	artois	don't make that mistake =)
2016-01-24 12:36:07	artois	they do seem more important lately than even ten years ago
2016-01-24 12:36:13	artois	too many people, I guess
2016-01-24 12:36:28	artois	if someone with a degree applies to a job, even if the degree has nothing to do with the duties...
2016-01-24 12:36:38	dangergrrl	apparently research level work as a full time employee requires a masters or preferably a PhD
2016-01-24 12:36:43	artois	because people with degrees think degrees matter, you see, heh
2016-01-24 12:36:52	dangergrrl	if you are a contractor they only care if you can do the job
2016-01-24 12:37:06	artois	if you're a sane employer you only care if a person can do the job
2016-01-24 12:37:13	artois	that's the problem: folk aren't sane
2016-01-24 12:37:50	dangergrrl	i did research work at Tandem (before Compaq bought them)

2016-01-26 11:50:16	+_`_	media-video/mediainfo gives pretty good output
2016-01-26 11:51:02	+_`_	playback being slow could be a number of things

2016-01-26 11:54:07	+_`_	oh right ffprobe(1) gives the same output as `ffmpeg -i file`

2016-02-08 14:29:57	lambd0x	artois: But if I emerged it again, could I force vboxdrv to be loaded in /etc/conf.d/modules?
2016-02-08 14:30:42	artois	yes, it's just a module like any other
2016-02-08 14:30:49	artois	you either load it or you don't
2016-02-08 14:33:13	lambd0x	artois: Sorry for so much elementary questions about it. When it comes to kernel I prefer to know absolutely everything before doing anything that could be harmful to my system. Thanks for you help, friend.

2016-02-08 14:39:20	lambd0x	artois: When issuing 'emerge -1 @module-build' does it affects loaded modules to be rebuild too?
2016-02-08 14:40:58	artois	it's only external modules, IIRC
2016-02-08 14:41:05	artois	which are the only ones that are a problem
2016-02-08 14:41:07	artois	hence the solution
2016-02-08 14:41:22	artois	the only ones that come to mind in my decade's use of Gentoo are...
2016-02-08 14:41:29	artois	nvidia-drivers' module, vbox's, and vmware's
2016-02-08 14:41:38	artois	usually from proprietary packages like those
2016-02-08 14:44:33	lambd0x	artois: After loading vboxdrv would be good to issue this command then.
2016-02-08 14:44:56	artois	no
2016-02-08 14:45:05	artois	vboxdrv is required by virtualbox
2016-02-08 14:45:15	artois	and vboxdrv must be built against the current running kernel's current source
2016-02-08 14:45:17	artois	_so_
2016-02-08 14:45:21	artois	/if/ you update your kernel
2016-02-08 14:45:25	artois	you need to rebuild vboxdrv
2016-02-08 14:45:34	artois	which you can do, IIRC, with @module-rebuild
2016-02-08 14:45:48	artois	I don't think you even need -1, but that's easily tested
2016-02-08 14:46:54	lambd0x	artois: Ok, this command then is really everything to solve vbox problem.
2016-02-08 14:47:27	artois	it could solve _a_ vbox problem

I have to type it every time and it's a bit annoying. I read the gentoo wiki and actually my system reads the gpg-agent config file but I can't change the time.

2016-02-09 05:14:27	yann-kaelig	Ha! I found something lxqt-base/lxqt-meta Do not install x11-wm/openbox window manager.  I suppose I can install another WM with minimal like fluxbox
2016-02-09 05:17:00	@angry_vincent	something like that
2016-02-09 05:17:34	Juippis	you need an USE flag to get openbox
2016-02-09 05:17:47	@angry_vincent	lumina is using fluxbox
2016-02-09 05:17:55	@angry_vincent	close projects
2016-02-09 05:19:51	yann-kaelig	look like interesting project lumina. I will test it into VM. There are some interesting things, no consolekit/policykit... and other's things. Mmm perhaps it's not lxqt I need for my musical worstation but fluxbox
2016-02-09 05:23:08	yann-kaelig	I try -policykit into make.conf but a package need consolekit and want policykit
2016-02-09 05:23:20	yann-kaelig	for lxqt
2016-02-09 05:25:02	@angry_vincent	not sure if possible to use lxqt without it

2016-02-09 09:59:32	PaddyMac	floppym I've never known of it as anything besides thin-manifests, and the term "thin-manifests" goes back to 2010 according to Google. I was hoping to find some early mention of it which might also refer to some prior name, but I did not find anything. Why do you need to know?
2016-02-09 10:00:48	floppym	PaddyMac: So I can look smart in #gentoo-portage.

2016-02-09 15:35:50	PaddyMac	Despite warnings about upgrading to gcc 5.3.0, I've almost completed recompiling my entire system with gcc 5.3.0. Granted it's a minimalistic home server with only 720 packages installed, so I didn't expect any issues. But I think the gcc 5.3.0 threat has been a bit overstated.
2016-02-09 15:36:29	PaddyMac	Just 34 packages to go. 720 packages in about 3 days isn't too bad for this old clunker.
2016-02-09 15:39:02	@angry_vincent	floppym: yep, it was mini-manifest in the past
2016-02-09 15:44:58	PaddyMac	That's why I love IRC. Someone can say something, and someone can reply 3 hours later, and it's still a completely valid conversation.

2016-02-16 08:26:04	javaJake	Completely random question. Has anyone done a lot of concurrent development in C++?
2016-02-16 08:26:50	javaJake	I've been messing with ReactiveX in Java and have been deeply impressed with the practical application of otherwise-impractical functional principles.
2016-02-16 08:27:43	javaJake	However, it seems like that kind of development (passing immutable data down a pipeline of possibly asynchronous functions) is not really something C++ wants to even think about.

2016-02-16 23:08:24	lambd0x	Hi everyone!
2016-02-16 23:08:27	reisio	heyo
2016-02-16 23:09:55	lambd0x	reisio: do you know if 'boot-update' command cause the system to detect not only funtoo kernels, but also another OSs if you emerge first os-prober?
2016-02-16 23:11:17	reisio	'fraid not, I don't use boot-update
2016-02-16 23:11:21	reisio	my guess would be yes, though
2016-02-16 23:11:28	reisio	it probably just calls grub/2-mkconfig
2016-02-16 23:12:36	 < 	m0ltar (~moltar_ne@103.243.171.124) has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2016-02-16 23:12:44	lambd0x	I'm in doubt about it. Cuz when I installed Funtoo I used 'grub2-mkconfig -o' ...

2016-02-16 23:14:12	lambd0x	Oh just reading the boot-update manpage... it says it creates a boot loader config based on /etc/boot.conf only
2016-02-16 23:15:04	lambd0x	reisio: :)
2016-02-16 23:16:03	lambd0x	reisio: I was just reading about kernel upgrades and this doubt came across me. Well good to know really
2016-02-16 23:16:25	lambd0x	reisio: Thanks for helping
2016-02-16 23:16:58	reisio	you can just check the grub.cfg afterwards
2016-02-16 23:19:21	lambd0x	reisio: Yeah, but the manpage of boot.config solved my doubt anyway
2016-02-16 23:19:35	lambd0x	*boot-update kk

2016-02-17 06:50:24	JDx	in the funtoo wiki (make.conf page) , it says users with SSD should consider moving portage temp dir to /tmp , in order to avoid the use of read/write operations on a SSD

2016-02-17 06:52:16	JDx	8 gigs

2016-02-17 06:52:56	@angry_vincent	set 6GB for example
2016-02-17 06:53:10	@angry_vincent	it maybe not enough for certain big pkgs

2016-02-17 13:04:06	Assuero	btw, some options that prevent userland to read /sys or /proc fs, could prevent hibernate... also some other options that prevend some manipulation of memory

2016-02-17 13:31:25	Assuero	no.. it's ok... the problem is that is not suspending or hibernating
2016-02-17 13:31:42	Assuero	is there no problem to lock the screen.. in fact i want it...
2016-02-17 13:31:43	trelane	drobbins, pong!
2016-02-17 13:32:17	Assuero	btw, i try to use hibernate/suspend conmmands also with root user, but evnet that not worked
2016-02-17 13:35:02	+_`_	are you trying to hibernate or suspend
2016-02-17 13:35:02		[13:35]
2016-02-17 13:35:12	+_`_	quite different
2016-02-17 13:35:30	Assuero	i tried both
2016-02-17 13:35:46	Assuero	firstly hibernate... not worked...
2016-02-17 13:35:58	Assuero	after i tried suspend... also not worked
2016-02-17 13:36:15	haxmeister	but what does it do exactly?
2016-02-17 13:36:19	+_`_	did you try manually printing the desired state to /sys/power/state ?
2016-02-17 13:36:39	+_`_	and if so did you check the ring buffer afterward?
2016-02-17 13:37:52	+_`_	https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/states.txt
2016-02-17 13:38:25	+_`_	grsec doesn't really impede on suspend, hibernate's another issue.

2016-02-17 13:55:46	Assuero	_`_, yes.. i tried..echo mem > /sys/power/state this command just blick the screen and back system normally
2016-02-17 13:56:31	Assuero	pm-hibernate also not worked..
2016-02-17 13:56:38	Assuero	i follow also this link: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Suspend_and_hibernate
2016-02-17 13:57:06	Assuero	i want any scenarious.. the best option is hibernate... but suspend to disk or ram, also is ok..
2016-02-17 13:58:05	+_`_	hibernate is to disk
2016-02-17 13:58:12	+_`_	suspend is to ram
2016-02-17 13:58:19	Assuero	focused on funtoo i only found it: http://www.funtoo.org/Power_Management
2016-02-17 13:58:39	Assuero	i know that.. i'm trying to setup any option
2016-02-17 13:59:16	+_`_	what do you mean it “blick the screen and back system”
2016-02-17 14:00:24	Assuero	the system "pretend" suspend... everything is black.. but few seconds after, everything back normal
2016-02-17 14:01:58	+_`_	and nothing in dmesg?

2016-02-17 20:02:35	Tassie_Tux	I am performing a fresh install for a virtual machine; currently chroot-ed and have just completed a world update
2016-02-17 20:03:51	Tassie_Tux	eselect-python updated
2016-02-17 20:04:43	Tassie_Tux	PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET is 3.4 however eselect python list indicates python2.7 - should I eselect python set python3.4?

2016-02-17 20:09:54	@angry_vincent	python2.7 is a default one in stages
2016-02-17 20:10:05	@angry_vincent	you can set 3.4 default if you want
2016-02-17 20:10:22	Tassie_Tux	I would prefer to set 3.4 :)
2016-02-17 20:11:30	Tassie_Tux	set
2016-02-17 20:11:44	Tassie_Tux	thanks
2016-02-17 20:12:18	wokko	Tassie_Tux: it probably is already your python3 default target 'eselect python list --python3'
2016-02-17 20:13:44	Tassie_Tux	wokko: so it is. I forget about that --python3 trick
2016-02-17 20:13:58	Tassie_Tux	wokko: ta
2016-02-17 20:17:17	wokko	Tassie_Tux: Just make sure that all your packages that require python can run with default 3_4 as I think some still rely on 2_7
2016-02-17 20:17:17		[20:17]
2016-02-17 20:19:12	@angry_vincent	Tassie_Tux: thx for kde pages updates
2016-02-17 20:19:24	@angry_vincent	ok, it seems glibc update is unavoidable
2016-02-17 20:20:12	Tassie_Tux	angry_vincent: happy to help. it is work in progress. I may be a bit awol over the next few weeks - moving house

2016-02-18 09:39:02	javaJake	For example, python2.7 --version, python3.3 --version
2016-02-18 09:39:16	zachron	javajake: they both report their correct version when run via 'python2.7 --version' and 'python3.3 --version'
2016-02-18 09:40:28	javaJake	Maybe the PYTHON_* configuration in make.conf is messing you up? What if you set PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_3" (instead of python3_4)?
2016-02-18 09:41:22	javaJake	Now I'm really curious because I got this exact issue on my Prefix but thought it was limited to Prefix environments.
2016-02-18 09:41:51	zachron	should i already have a PYTHON_TARGETS in make.conf? cause i dont
2016-02-18 09:42:21	javaJake	Well, hm. I'm just wondering if for some reason it expects python3.4 to be installed, because that's default now, but since it isn't, it fails.

2016-02-18 09:43:07	javaJake	So maybe instead of 'emerge -a1O portage' do 'emerge -1 portage' and let python3.4 install?
2016-02-18 09:43:11	javaJake	I'm assuming it's not.
2016-02-18 09:43:30	javaJake	So maybe instead of 'emerge -a1O portage' do 'emerge -1 portage' and let python3.4 install? <<< this is instead of setting PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_3" in make.conf
2016-02-18 09:45:13	zachron	when i do that it fails with this: http://pastebin.com/6EJ6yzS1
2016-02-18 09:46:12	javaJake	Oh, this is fun.
2016-02-18 09:46:30	javaJake	Try PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_3" and emerge -1 portage?
2016-02-18 09:47:11	javaJake	Then undo the PYTHON_TARGETS and let a @world update bump python appropriately to avoid the blockers in your previous paste?
2016-02-18 09:48:04	zachron	that worked for getting portage updated
2016-02-18 09:48:22	javaJake	OK, so now undo the PYTHON_* config and let portage update @world?
2016-02-18 09:48:36	javaJake	Maybe 2.4.1 does provide EAPI 6.
2016-02-18 09:50:24	zachron	javajake: yeah that appears to have resolved my issue. thanks!

2016-02-18 09:50:29	javaJake	No problem
2016-02-18 09:51:40	javaJake	angry_vincent: there appears to be a bug in python_* ebuild functions which assume PYTHON_TARGETS=... also represents a usable Python installation. I bet anyone who hasn't updated to portage 2.4.1 before the PYTHON_TARGETS bump will have to go through that ^^^

2016-02-19 06:05:14	reisio	Uniaika: Funtoo's tree out of sync with Gentoo's again
2016-02-19 06:05:24	reisio	this is a really, really, really common problem
2016-02-19 06:05:38	reisio	I don't really understand why it endures, it should be easily fixed
2016-02-19 06:06:17	javaJake	Certain packages are sharded if they're known to cause issues during updates.
2016-02-19 06:06:32	@angry_vincent	ruby2.3 and all that sutff is masked in Funtoo
2016-02-19 06:06:32	reisio	Uniaika: temporary solution would be to take Gentoo's eselect-ruby-20151229 and put it in an overlay, or put off using that version of whatever package needs the newer eselect-ruby
2016-02-19 06:06:33	javaJake	But that also means updates are missed and cause missed dependencies like this
2016-02-19 06:06:46	reisio	yeah, you should also mask things that dep on them, in that case
2016-02-19 06:07:18	Uniaika	;_;
2016-02-19 06:07:21	Uniaika	damnit
2016-02-19 06:07:29	reisio	that's how I would feel if I were you :p
2016-02-19 06:08:20	reisio	it doesn't really help to "protect" users from something you consider unstable by making other things further unstable by not properly masking/removing things that have completely unavailable deps
2016-02-19 06:08:38	@angry_vincent	obviously
2016-02-19 06:08:46	reisio	well I would have thought so :)

2016-02-19 06:24:30	sandro_	However there is a group in facebook called "Amici di Funtoo" (in italian) .... and i've posted 4 videos with recordmydesktop to make an example about the Funtoo installation and configuration :)

2016-02-19 06:27:43	@angry_vincent	what was the problem then? bad kernel config?
2016-02-19 06:31:12	sandro_	angry_vincent:i've make various experiment either with "Stable" than "Current" and i've not encountered trouble with genkernel :)

2016-02-19 06:31:56	sandro_	but if you want tell me ...... if i can make an experiment thath may be util to test genkernel :)
2016-02-19 06:33:04	sandro_	angry_vincent: may be that the trouble was related to a "bad config file" ......

2016-02-19 14:54:24	splash_wave	yeah lol
2016-02-19 14:54:59	splash_wave	anyone?
2016-02-19 14:55:16	PaddyMac	No, but if you have an answer for my question, I can at least make up an answer for yours.
2016-02-19 14:55:43	splash_wave	whats your question?
2016-02-19 14:56:43	PaddyMac	How can I make text files originating from a DOS environment with high ASCII character display correctly?
2016-02-19 14:57:09	PaddyMac	A lot of the high ASCII characters display as circles with question marks in them.
2016-02-19 14:58:07	splash_wave	whats "high ASCII"
2016-02-19 14:58:35	PaddyMac	charcters 128-255 (I think) in the ASCII character set.
2016-02-19 14:59:19	PaddyMac	low ASCII is 0-127
2016-02-19 14:59:21	splash_wave	what program are you opening the text files in?
2016-02-19 14:59:58	PaddyMac	Usually nano, but I've tried vi, cat, more, and other such utilities for displaying text. All with the same result.
2016-02-19 15:00:15	splash_wave	so what are your text files for?
2016-02-19 15:00:24	PaddyMac	I found a few discussions on the 'net about the issue but no real answers.
2016-02-19 15:01:00	PaddyMac	generally they are text files included with old DOS software.

2016-02-19 15:01:49	PaddyMac	I'm wondering if maybe there is some eselect fontconfig setting or something that might help.
2016-02-19 15:02:44	splash_wave	i would try opening them in notepad or worded on a windows machine
2016-02-19 15:02:44		[15:02]
2016-02-19 15:02:56	splash_wave	there might be more character and font support
2016-02-19 15:03:07	PaddyMac	Like maybe is there a way to force using a specific font when displaying certain kinds of files? Like the terminus font, for example? Or maybe dejavu-sans-mono.
2016-02-19 15:03:39	PaddyMac	Hmmm.... I wonder if Wine's notepad would display them correctly...
2016-02-19 15:03:55	splash_wave	yeah
2016-02-19 15:04:04	splash_wave	so u run what distro?
2016-02-19 15:04:05	PaddyMac	I'm pretty sure they would display correctly under Windows XP.
2016-02-19 15:04:13	splash_wave	yeah windows xp might
2016-02-19 15:04:14	PaddyMac	I'm running Funtoo.
2016-02-19 15:04:53	PaddyMac	Rebooting into XP is inconvenient, but perhaps it could help out if I really need to see something the right way.
2016-02-19 15:05:49	PaddyMac	Since ASCII and ANSI stuff is so old-school, there isn't much modern software that handles it correctly.
2016-02-19 15:06:30	PaddyMac	We're talking stuff that went out of vogue 15-20 years ago.
2016-02-19 15:06:59	PaddyMac	Is there a way to force programs to use a specific font?
2016-02-19 15:07:05	 < 	michaelrose (~michael@71-212-33-3.tukw.qwest.net) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-02-19 15:07:38	reisio	like which programs?
2016-02-19 15:08:12	splash_wave	are you running a desktop gui?
2016-02-19 15:09:31	PaddyMac	Well, I'm running KDE 4 on my main desktop, and I'm running another box headless, but I can VNC or x2go into it with LXDE.
2016-02-19 15:10:02	PaddyMac	reisio: Like nano, for example.
2016-02-19 15:10:18	PaddyMac	reisio: Or maybe putty
2016-02-19 15:11:20	splash_wave	what about opening them in open office
2016-02-19 15:11:21	reisio	putty yes, it has its own config
2016-02-19 15:11:28	reisio	nano is a terminal app, it might not
2016-02-19 15:11:35	reisio	you might have to rely on the terminal's config
2016-02-19 15:12:23	PaddyMac	How would I use putty to use a specific font?
2016-02-19 15:13:25	splash_wave	putty is SSH... why would we even consider using that? aren't we supposed to open text files in text editors or word process programs?
2016-02-19 15:15:02	 > 	michaelrose (~michael@71-212-33-3.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #funtoo
2016-02-19 15:16:12	reisio	that argument is going to be lost on a putty user
2016-02-19 15:16:19	reisio	PaddyMac: it has it in prefs
2016-02-19 15:20:38	splash_wave	so does anyone have an answer to setting a password on a fat32 external drive?

2016-02-19 15:23:45	PaddyMac	reisio: The Debian putty isn't giving me any options. But I ssh'd with X11-forwarding into my headless server (which is Funtoo), and puttytel does give me options. One of the options is to use ISO-8859-1 as the character set. That *should* cause things to display correctly.
2016-02-19 15:24:28	reisio	splash_wave: what for
2016-02-19 15:24:51	reisio	the unix port of putty has the same GUI prefs AFAIK
2016-02-19 15:26:13	PaddyMac	Well, I want to use Putty to access an ANSI BBS over telnet.
2016-02-19 15:26:30	PaddyMac	ISO-8859-1 maybe isn't what I need after all... I may have to try different encodings.

2016-02-19 15:29:15	splash_wave	nvm
2016-02-19 15:29:37	splash_wave	my friend who has this drive that wants a password is exchanging his disk for another
2016-02-19 15:30:03	reisio	mmmkay
2016-02-19 15:32:11	PaddyMac	Yeah. I may just have to tinker with this a bit. Apparently the Debian and Funtoo implementations of PuTTY are different.
2016-02-19 15:32:40	PaddyMac	I may just end up doing what a friend did and run Telix or Telemate under DOSBox.

2016-02-19 15:41:00	splash_wave	gui**
2016-02-19 15:42:36	reisio	Xfce mostly, been meaning to switch to a tiling wm for years
2016-02-19 15:42:40	reisio	r-e-i-TAB
2016-02-19 15:43:09	splash_wave	do u ever read or hack the x11 source?
2016-02-19 15:43:50	reisio	incredibly rarely I have looked at xlib stuff
2016-02-19 15:45:08	splash_wave	i know xlib is of course a library.. but what functions does it offer?

2016-02-19 15:48:52	splash_wave	gui

2016-02-19 15:59:52	splash_wave	so meaning i shouldn't dive into xlib or x11 source?
2016-02-19 16:02:19	reisio	yes, you can make a GUI with xlib alone
2016-02-19 16:02:28	reisio	fontforge uses it, IIRC
2016-02-19 16:02:31	reisio	xfontsel
2016-02-19 16:02:38	reisio	that one X calc program
2016-02-19 16:02:48	reisio	it's pretty rudimentary on its own
2016-02-19 16:03:16	reisio	if you want to get into GUI stuff, for the masses, anyway, you should probably look at GTK+ or Qt, or whatever wayland is getting into, if it differs largely from xlib
2016-02-19 16:03:28	reisio	as wayland will replace X soon enough

2016-02-20 04:32:03	blaise	I'm really curious as to why?
2016-02-20 04:32:25	blaise	also, when will be we getting kcm-touchpad-frameworks

2016-02-20 04:32:53	@angry_vincent	what's that

2016-02-20 04:34:23	blaise	well, we had 5.5.4 and then it went missing
2016-02-20 04:34:43	blaise	kensington: so the touchpad useflag for plasma-desktop?
2016-02-20 04:34:48	kensington	yes
2016-02-20 04:35:23	blaise	kensington: thank you, I had completely missed that
2016-02-20 04:36:26	@angry_vincent	do you have more info about regression?
2016-02-20 04:36:56	@angry_vincent	it could be resolved by updates
2016-02-20 04:38:46	blaise	angry_vincent: version 5.5.4 isn't visiable in portage nore do I see the ebuilds
2016-02-20 04:39:11	blaise	I currently have them installed, as I've not commited the regression

2016-02-20 04:40:42	blaise	I'm not inquiring about a bug.. I had updated to plasma-meta-4.4.5 and about 3 to 7 days ago the ebuilds went missing from the tree
2016-02-20 04:41:08	blaise	angry_vincent: do you have a plasma-meta-4.4.5.ebuild ?
2016-02-20 04:41:55	blaise	plasma-meta-5.5.49 is current upstream I think

2016-02-20 04:42:35	blaise	portage is wanting to fall back to plasma-meta-5.4.3 since that is the latest version remaining in the tree
2016-02-20 04:42:47	@angry_vincent	i'm not sure i getting the problem
2016-02-20 04:43:26	@angry_vincent	portage output probably could enlighten this

2016-02-20 06:38:28	Zedax	hey do you know when trying to build icedtea it also tries to merge icedtea-bin? i don't want the binary but build it from scratch.,.
2016-02-20 06:38:54	@angry_vincent	yes, its needed
2016-02-20 06:39:28	Zedax	dev-java/icedtea-7.2.6.3-r4:7::gentoo   won't build the source?
2016-02-20 06:39:58	Zedax	angry_vincent, do you mean that it's needed to build it?
2016-02-20 06:39:59	@angry_vincent	to build icedtea form source, you need a gcj (a gcc's java) or other already compiled java (like icedtea-bin)
2016-02-20 06:40:04	@angry_vincent	right
2016-02-20 06:40:11	Zedax	alright
2016-02-20 06:40:24	@angry_vincent	you can remove icedtea-bin after

2016-02-20 07:02:15	quiznilo	Zedax_: 2 things about that though, first, I set it going in the background, and can do my work and not have my computer lock up on me
2016-02-20 07:02:29	quiznilo	or if I have it going overnight, who cares if it takes 4 hours instead of 1
2016-02-20 07:03:09	Zedax_	in that case :), but libreoffice or other on just one core.. is going to be painful xD
2016-02-20 07:03:09	quiznilo	secondly, yeah, it takes longer, but I was getting some build errors with MAKEOPTS > 1
2016-02-20 07:03:26	quiznilo	nah, not painful, just have it going in the background

2016-02-20 08:51:49	blaise	quiznilo: I ran cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log |grep font and got this.. https://bpaste.net/show/a6809d28582f
2016-02-20 08:51:55	blaise	quiznilo: could that have something to do with it?
2016-02-20 08:52:04	michaelrose	so there is a regression in the newest version of compton
2016-02-20 08:52:12	quiznilo	no
2016-02-20 08:52:15	quiznilo	I get that too

2016-02-20 08:52:36	quiznilo	I don't think your dm has anything to do with xorg
2016-02-20 08:52:44	quiznilo	xorg is not running when the dm is
2016-02-20 08:53:23	michaelrose	with the newest version of compton in portage + nvidia drivers + mpv built with vdpau doing other things while mpv is playing causes mpv to stutter
2016-02-20 08:53:36	michaelrose	easiest example is deleting and opening tabs in firefox
2016-02-20 08:54:40	michaelrose	I tried several combinations of settings most recent and prior version of nvidia drivers and the 2 most recent versions of mpv + 9999 version
2016-02-20 08:55:15	blaise	I rebuilt qtcore and am rebuilding qtgui now
2016-02-20 08:55:23	blaise	those are deps of sddm...
2016-02-20 08:55:34	blaise	freefont is a dep of qt though
2016-02-20 08:55:37	blaise	so.......
2016-02-20 08:55:44	blaise	maybe I need to rebuild that as well
2016-02-20 08:55:51	michaelrose	essentially went through all the permutations of 3 different mpv versions 2 different nvidia-drivers, with and without compton and with and without vdpau
2016-02-20 08:56:13	michaelrose	before discovering that a recent update of compton is to blame
2016-02-20 08:57:28	michaelrose	essentially the issue only obtains if you update compton to 0.1._beta2, have compton running, and run mpv with vdpau enabled
2016-02-20 08:58:31	blaise	or, freetype I mean
2016-02-20 08:58:31		[08:58]
2016-02-20 09:01:53	blaise	michaelrose: didn't mpv go stale?
2016-02-20 09:02:37	blaise	wow, guess not

2016-02-20 09:22:20	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: which number ?
2016-02-20 09:22:29	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: is this your processor ? http://ark.intel.com/it/products/49020/Intel-Core-i3-370M-Processor-3M-cache-2_40-GHz
2016-02-20 09:22:47	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: yes it is
2016-02-20 09:23:18	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: I read on wikipedia that it's un Arrandale family
2016-02-20 09:23:28	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: excuse me .... i'm searching for "nearest technology"

2016-02-20 09:24:11	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: ok, thank you very much
2016-02-20 09:24:37	sandro_	I think thath may be a Sandy-bridge based processor

2016-02-20 09:26:14	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: mine is the 3rd of the 1st list
2016-02-20 09:26:57	 > 	hawkandbaby (~hawkandba@68.71.19.150) has joined #funtoo
2016-02-20 09:26:58	sandro_	no ... it is not a Sandy bridge cause doesn't support AVX instructions then first core "i*" cpu i think
2016-02-20 09:28:01	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: I read that sandybridge is the 2nd edition of the i3 for laptop
2016-02-20 09:28:17	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: and Arrandale are the 1st edition
2016-02-20 09:28:40	sandro_	Saandy-bridge is 2nd generation for i3, i5 and i7  (and Xeon) processors
2016-02-20 09:29:20	sandro_	try this
2016-02-20 09:29:20		[09:29]
2016-02-20 09:29:29	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: yes. The 1st generation for i3 are nehalem... but i don't know if it's that...
2016-02-20 09:29:44	sandro_	grep pclmul /proc/cpuinfo
2016-02-20 09:30:14	sandro_	Use the stage3 for first generation .....
2016-02-20 09:30:50	sandro_	but you'll can use *FLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe" ....
2016-02-20 09:31:12	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: for the moment I've got generic_64 tarball
2016-02-20 09:31:27	sandro_	Ok ....
2016-02-20 09:31:31	TheSuperGeek	what do the command grep pclmul should do ?
2016-02-20 09:32:33	sandro_	with generic you (if you want) make an emerge -e world after declaring epro subarch native_64
2016-02-20 09:32:49	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: okay
2016-02-20 09:33:02	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: thank you very much for your help !
2016-02-20 09:33:18	sandro_	I post my make.conf ... take a look about *FLAGS ... just a moment ....
2016-02-20 09:34:17	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: http://pastebin.com/U8cZ0Kg6
2016-02-20 09:34:49	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: ok
2016-02-20 09:34:51	sandro_	and in forums.funtoo.org there is a discussion about make.conf configuration :)
2016-02-20 09:35:27	sandro_	I love the -march=native ... so gcc can read all instructions for your processor :)
2016-02-20 09:35:39	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: cool
2016-02-20 09:35:53	sandro_	cause also one processor family , changing stepping may have differencies :)
2016-02-20 09:36:41	TheSuperGeek	but what is native ?
2016-02-20 09:36:57	TheSuperGeek	because I don't see it on subarchs page
2016-02-20 09:37:34	sandro_	no ... native must be declared after first installation of stage3 :)
2016-02-20 09:37:40	TheSuperGeek	ok
2016-02-20 09:38:22	sandro_	I make an example: about -march=core2, there are 2 steppings :)
2016-02-20 09:39:02	sandro_	if you declared -march=core2, you will have not the sse4.2 cause implemented in "Penryn" processors :)
2016-02-20 09:39:29	TheSuperGeek	ok
2016-02-20 09:40:00	TheSuperGeek	thank you for all sandro_ ! and good night (if it's night in your country ;) )
2016-02-20 09:40:09	sandro_	more than 2 steppings in core2 ...... but 2 different processors (changing also technology from 65 nm to 45 nm) ....
2016-02-20 09:40:34	sandro_	TheSuperGeek: i'm in Italy :) 23:40 :)
2016-02-20 09:40:51	sandro_	Ah also for the kernel you can optimize .....
2016-02-20 09:41:12	TheSuperGeek	sandro_: i'm in france and it's the same hour :P
2016-02-20 09:41:21	sandro_	for the firs time may be you'll choice the "included" debian-sources.
2016-02-20 09:41:34	sandro_	but if you want to create a custom kernel:

2016-02-21 10:52:51	PaddyMac	reisio: Portage is plenty fast until you start adding overlays.
2016-02-21 10:54:05	PaddyMac	Even adding just a couple of overlays can make a very noticeable difference, and adding a lot of overlays can make a difference of a few seconds calculation going up to half an hour calculation.
2016-02-21 10:55:09	reisio	I only ever have a single small local overlay at most
2016-02-21 10:55:19	reisio	I do have kinda old hardware, though
2016-02-21 10:55:27	reisio	probably wouldn't notice with a newer box/more ram/ssd, etc.
2016-02-21 10:55:42	PaddyMac	There wouldn't be so many overlays if it weren't such a slow process getting new ebuilds into the main tree.
2016-02-21 10:56:21	PaddyMac	There are a lot of talented ebuild writers who just say f*** it and make their own overlay.
2016-02-21 11:00:31	reisio	yeah, that I believe
2016-02-21 11:00:31		[11:00]
2016-02-21 11:00:48	reisio	luckily portage is wonderful enough to make that an easy choice, though
2016-02-21 11:01:27	reisio	so, I don't think that's my problem at all, but, to continue this conversation
2016-02-21 11:01:37	reisio	couldn't you store overlay ebuilds/files in /usr/portage/ and that'd speed it all up?
2016-02-21 11:01:44	reisio	and use postsync to maintain it?

2016-02-21 11:21:58	darlinger	hello anyone :) dropping in to say hi from NJ
2016-02-21 11:22:08	reisio	ohio
2016-02-21 11:22:27	 < 	proteusguy_satri (~proteusgu@183.88.73.82) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2016-02-21 11:24:39	darlinger	is that your way of saying hello or your state ;)
2016-02-21 11:24:40	PaddyMac	I don't know how overlays are handled internally by Portage, but it seems to me that the fastest way to handle overlays would be if Portage saw the main tree and all overlays together as a single, virtual tree.
2016-02-21 11:25:10	darlinger	PaddyMac: what happens when you have ebuild collisions?
2016-02-21 11:25:16	darlinger	it's called "overlay" for a reason
2016-02-21 11:25:31	darlinger	also some overlays use subversion -_-
2016-02-21 11:25:55	PaddyMac	By collision, do you mean two ebuilds that have the exact same name?
2016-02-21 11:26:18	darlinger	yes
2016-02-21 11:26:45	PaddyMac	There is already a sort of hierarchy in place that determines which one takes precedence.
2016-02-21 11:28:18	PaddyMac	I'm no expert, but if that can be handled now, I don't see why it couldn't be handled in a "virtual-tree" scenario.
2016-02-21 11:28:39	+_`_	taking precedence is asymmetric from your hypothetical solution
2016-02-21 11:28:44	PaddyMac	Implement some reasonable defaults that can be overridden by commandline switches.
2016-02-21 11:30:29	PaddyMac	Maybe a virtual tree could be created prior to runtime and updated whenever the Portage tree or overlays are updated.
2016-02-21 11:30:51	+_`_	I don't like that idea
2016-02-21 11:30:57	+_`_	at all
2016-02-21 11:32:14	reisio	well, if you only have things you actually want/require in your overlay
2016-02-21 11:32:27	reisio	there's really no harm overwriting normal portage tree versions
2016-02-21 11:32:30	+_`_	sounds like said virtual tree would have to consist of an atom from either the main repository OR another one.
2016-02-21 11:32:34	reisio	except that a sync would over-overwrite them
2016-02-21 11:32:36	reisio	hence postsync
2016-02-21 11:33:00	reisio	there are FSes for merging two separate FSes, though, of course
2016-02-21 11:33:00		[11:33]
2016-02-21 11:33:02	+_`_	and to change whatever is used for an atom, I'd have to regenerate the virtual tree each time
2016-02-21 11:33:14	+_`_	even union mounts don't really help here imo.

2016-02-21 11:34:57	reisio	well it'd help for having a union mount, which is what he was suggesting, AIUI
2016-02-21 11:37:34	PaddyMac	Well, I didn't have in mind a unionfs-type solution -- not an actual one, anyway. Just some sort of virtual union of all the overlays and main tree together that Portage sees. Because it seems that would speed up dependency calculations in a scenario where lots of overlays were used.
2016-02-21 11:38:58	reisio	I imagine in that event, the overhead of the unionfs might negate the benefits
2016-02-21 11:39:01	reisio	but not necessarily
2016-02-21 11:39:13	PaddyMac	But I wonder... Just for the experimenting... "for science", as they say.... what would happen if someone tried a union approach on their filesystem without altering Portage just to see what would happen.
2016-02-21 11:39:47	+_`_	overlayfs isn't really suitable for this, aufs isn't something every one's going to want to patch in/default to, and whatever halfbaked fuse unionfs implementations are still fuse. And it'd still be annoying for interchanging which repository's atom is what's being used.

2016-02-21 11:42:45	reisio	without altering portage would be the ideal way IMO
2016-02-21 11:42:49	reisio	outside of altering portage
2016-02-21 11:44:38	PaddyMac	I wonder if Poudriere or Synth could be a source of inspiration for improvements to Portage.

2016-02-21 11:47:00	+_`_	poudriere's functionality should have been part of the ports system to begin with in a much similar fashion

2016-02-21 11:51:09	reisio	inspiration from the unspellable
2016-02-21 11:51:09		[11:51]
2016-02-21 11:51:59	PaddyMac	After a short experiment with FreeBSD, the speed of the system was the main thing I liked But I think that was due to maybe a lack of any extensive prechecking or calculation of any kind. It's like it just started and hoped everything worked correctly.
2016-02-21 11:52:28	PaddyMac	Referring to the ports system....
2016-02-21 11:55:04	Arfrever	darlinger, PaddyMac: The reason for word "overlay" disappeared in year 2009.
2016-02-21 11:55:27	reisio	why's that?
2016-02-21 11:56:14	Arfrever	reisio: Question for me?
2016-02-21 11:56:44	reisio	yes
2016-02-21 11:56:46	PaddyMac	Seems like I vaguely remember reading something recently about a change in preferred nomenclature for overlays, but I don't recall the details.
2016-02-21 11:57:17	+_`_	manual refers to them as repositories usually
2016-02-21 11:57:30	Arfrever	Word "overlay" is from times when eclasses from repositories later in [PORTDIR]+PORTDIR_OVERLAY were overlaying eclasses from earlier repositories.
2016-02-21 11:57:50	reisio	PORTDIR_OVERLAY?
2016-02-21 11:57:59	reisio	that's in the man still
2016-02-21 11:58:07	reisio	eh, okay
2016-02-21 11:58:10	Arfrever	Word "overlay" is incorrect since introduction of masters settings in repositories.
2016-02-21 11:58:14	reisio	I thought you meant it actually had its reasoning disappear
2016-02-21 11:58:15	+_`_	that variable has been long since deprecated
2016-02-21 11:58:19	reisio	and not that it was replaced with another word
2016-02-21 11:58:21	Arfrever	PORTDIR/PORTDIR_OVERLAY variables are deprecated.
2016-02-21 11:58:33	reisio	thank goodness deprecated isn't obsoleted :D
2016-02-21 11:58:56	Arfrever	https://gitweb.gentoo.org/proj/portage.git/commit/?id=2bd2620142d15344f32ef67896c4fa88e5386953
2016-02-21 11:59:16	PaddyMac	Well, whether they're called overlays or repositories, that doesn't change the fact that using them slows down Portage's dependency calculations.
2016-02-21 11:59:27	reisio	I see what you're saying, and I don't take any issue with it, but you just can't unname something, it isn't possible
2016-02-21 11:59:32	Arfrever	PaddyMac: Only if missing cache.
2016-02-21 11:59:40	reisio	all you do is make multiple names for something that once had only one :D
2016-02-21 12:00:10	Arfrever	If a name is no longer correct, then it should not be used.
2016-02-21 12:00:47	+_`_	unfortunately if ubiquity already hit in, it's tough
2016-02-21 12:00:57	+_`_	just gotta hope people adapt
2016-02-21 12:01:01	PaddyMac	Arfrever: Then an awful lot of overlays must be missing metadata caches. But I really don't think that's the only factor. I've had multiple overlays installed and generated my own local metadata cache, and it still is slow as Christmas when lot of overlays are installed.

2016-02-22 10:29:43	masonhauk	whats up funtoo
2016-02-22 10:30:08	masonhauk	im looking to make a funtoo/gentoo live usb install
2016-02-22 10:30:13	masonhauk	any ideas
2016-02-22 10:30:32	chry	Whatcha mean by that?
2016-02-22 10:30:59	chry	You need a live usb distro for *too install, or you wanna make one? ;3
2016-02-22 10:32:27	masonhauk	well, I want to have funtoo or gentoo installed on a usb like a dual boot just only the usb drive holds the os, making any chnges while uptime down time next boot changes from previous are still kept
2016-02-22 10:33:01	masonhauk	meaning ive tried installing gentoo livedvd to usb from unetbooten etc rufis sysrescd and all changes are discarded
2016-02-22 10:33:09	masonhauk	only temp runs exist
2016-02-22 10:33:46	masonhauk	to be honest id prefer funtoo...
2016-02-22 10:34:25	masonhauk	but if i cant get the kernel right because this is a new lenovo ideapad 100 laptop
2016-02-22 10:34:38	masonhauk	without papi kernel seeds makes things hard
2016-02-22 10:36:48	chry	Well, here's a sort of an idea: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/LiveDVD-Persistence-Mode
2016-02-22 10:38:10	masonhauk	hmm
2016-02-22 10:38:23	masonhauk	ok so I wouldnt need to partition the drive like the guide
2016-02-22 10:41:23	michaelrose	generally you do the entire install in a single session and this often is a short one at that

2016-02-22 14:36:16	forumirc|65415	thanks chry I'll try that, really hope this works :(
2016-02-22 14:37:52	chry	Me too. ;p

2016-02-22 14:59:35	forumirc|65415	ah what the hell, it says dependencies could not be completely resolved due to the following required packages not being installed: >=sys-boot/grub-2.00-r5 pulled in by sys-boot/boot-update

2016-02-22 15:05:16	forumirc|65415	sda or sda1? sda1 is the boot partition
2016-02-22 15:07:16	reisio	grub is installed usually to the device, not the partition

2016-02-24 07:24:13	stakewinner00	if i don't want postfix, how can i remove it and avoid it to be installed when doing emerge -auvDN @world?
2016-02-24 07:30:00		[07:24]
2016-02-24 07:33:14	javaJake	stakewinner00: do you have it installed?
2016-02-24 07:33:24	stakewinner00	yes
2016-02-24 07:33:36	javaJake	stakewinner00: emerge --depclean -v postfix # tells you who pulls it
2016-02-24 07:33:53	stakewinner00	but when i do emerge -auvDN @world it try to install postfix again
2016-02-24 07:34:15	javaJake	If it's a new package you can use --tree to see who pulls what in your emerge @world
2016-02-24 07:34:29	javaJake	On my install:
2016-02-24 07:34:33	javaJake	  mail-mta/postfix-3.0.1-r1 pulled in by:
2016-02-24 07:34:34	javaJake	    virtual/mta-1 requires mail-mta/postfix
2016-02-24 07:35:45	 < 	michaelrose (~michael@174-31-161-24.tukw.qwest.net) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2016-02-24 07:36:25	javaJake	stakewinner00: virtual/mta, for example, is pulled by sudo when USE="sendmail" is set (and it is by default)
2016-02-24 07:36:51	javaJake	I found that by doing 'emerge --depclean -pv virtual/mta'
2016-02-24 07:37:08	javaJake	And then reading the ebuild to see where it is in the *DEPEND variables

2016-02-24 07:39:00	javaJake	I have fcron installed and it has: mta? ( virtual/mta ) which means when USE="mta" (and it is by default per the ebuild's IUSE=".... +mta ....") then it needs virtual/mta

2016-02-24 07:41:13	stakewinner00	mmm i think i have not sendmail in USE flag.
2016-02-24 07:41:40	javaJake	It's set by default in sudo's ebuild, so you have to explicitly turn it off
2016-02-24 07:41:47	javaJake	Same with mta
2016-02-24 07:41:51	stakewinner00	oh, ok. thanks
2016-02-24 07:42:23	gromez	hi, is there a reason why englightenment-0.20.5 from official gentoo portage tree has not been merge in funtoo tree? or just have to wait few days?
2016-02-24 07:43:47	javaJake	stakewinner00: if you mask postfix, that's a way of forcing portage to not consider it, and that will cause portage to throw dependency stacks you can follow when something depends on it.
2016-02-24 07:44:10	javaJake	I did that with kdelibs to have a Plasma 5 pure system for a long time.

2016-02-24 10:51:45	reisio	lxde isn't more than openbox & utils enough for me to like it, really

2016-02-24 10:51:53	*	reisio shrugs
2016-02-24 10:52:02	reisio	I s'pose I should give it a brief look
2016-02-24 10:52:16	reisio	I'm guessing lxde hasn't any real opposition to GNOME/dconf madness, either
2016-02-24 10:52:33	reisio	I had assumed, all these years, that Xfce had one, even if informally
2016-02-24 10:52:36	reisio	but that is apparently not the case
2016-02-24 10:52:52	reisio	I just don't see who their target user base is if they require that many GNOME deps
2016-02-24 10:53:04	reisio	seems like Xfce was always the version of GNOME without the awful GNOME deps...
2016-02-24 10:53:18	reisio	Digit: Lisp, also not really my thing :)
2016-02-24 10:53:33	reisio	but if it was, common lisp would be the one I would aim at, obviously
2016-02-24 10:54:22	haxmeister	Steel Bank Common Lisp... best one prolly
2016-02-24 10:54:30	haxmeister	unless you like JVM
2016-02-24 10:55:32	reisio	steel bank, that sounds like a windowsy thing
2016-02-24 10:55:43	reisio	anyway, lisp isn't really my thing, common or not :D
2016-02-24 10:55:48	reisio	don't care for the syntax
2016-02-24 10:56:19	haxmeister	the scheme subset is more interesting.. but yeah the syntax and all the ()() turn a lot of peeps off
2016-02-24 10:56:28	reisio	yeah, scheme is interesting
2016-02-24 10:56:30	reisio	and so is lisp, really
2016-02-24 10:56:34	reisio	but I don't care for the syntax
2016-02-24 10:56:46	haxmeister	( . Y . )

2016-02-24 11:22:00	sandro_	but not under Funtoo :(
2016-02-24 11:22:20	haxmeister	I think a mouse maze would be fun to do.. with arduino controlling doors/buttons etc..
2016-02-24 11:22:24	sandro_	i'm trying to stalk those friends with Funtoo :D :D :D
2016-02-24 11:22:55	sandro_	I must learn more about Arduino ....
2016-02-24 11:23:10	sandro_	excuse me haxmeister ....
2016-02-24 11:23:27	sandro_	but 1 thing at once .... step by step :)

2016-02-24 11:24:21	sandro_	these night (for me 01:24 am) i'm very happy about new nvidia-drivers that have solved a (for me) critical situation.
2016-02-24 11:24:50	sandro_	If you have questions about Arduino i can tell to my friends (but they uses Fedora .... :|)

2016-02-24 11:34:40	xemacs	shamus397, commonlisp has alien
2016-02-24 11:34:53	shamus397	alien?
2016-02-24 11:35:05	xemacs	that all i know sorry
2016-02-24 11:35:10	shamus397	:-)
2016-02-24 11:35:37	xemacs	but i think it is what you may be looking for
2016-02-24 11:36:01	shamus397	there isn't even an easy way to get stuff back that you typed into the top level loop :-P
2016-02-24 11:36:01		[11:36]
2016-02-24 11:36:12	xemacs	cmucl is faster then other commonlisp implementations

2016-02-24 11:38:27	shamus397	hmm, a quick google search for 'lisp alien gui' turns up nothing. typical :-P
2016-02-24 11:39:50	xemacs	it is part of the language
2016-02-24 11:40:13	xemacs	or the specification of it is
2016-02-24 11:40:29	shamus397	oh, the abandoned stuff then
2016-02-24 11:40:43	reisio	try 'lisp asplien ghuiiiisppplt'
2016-02-24 11:41:18	Digit	mmmm haskell.  whole classes of problems just disapear.  n if one learns haskell as their first language, they need never experience a day of stress from unwanted dirty side effects.  :)
2016-02-24 11:41:38	shamus397	i've that about lisp, too :-P
2016-02-24 11:41:41	shamus397	*heard
2016-02-24 11:41:51	Digit	hehe, lisps have /some/ of that, yeah.
2016-02-24 11:43:13	reisio	Digit: don't say that, you might make me interested in it :p
2016-02-24 11:44:21	xemacs	i have googled "alien data common lisp" found it i think
2016-02-24 11:44:40	Digit	danger danger!   we're already past the point of no return.  the interest seed has been planted.  now it's only a matter of time... will you water it slow, or fast.  ;)
2016-02-24 11:44:48	xemacs	shamus397,  i have googled "alien data common lisp" found it i think
2016-02-24 11:47:34	shamus397	interesting, but nothing to do with gui programming :-)
2016-02-24 11:48:28	Digit	reisio: you might still manage to put it off for the rest of your life... ;) so long as you didnt start: mpv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLj1QV11o9g

2016-02-24 11:54:43	reisio	the real problem with this is that I was liking Xfce for a bridge between what I need and what people I build installs for are used to
2016-02-24 11:54:45	haxmeister	reisio, I am a CNC machinist so I program and operate a CNC mill daily.
2016-02-24 11:55:02	reisio	haxmeister: oh sweet
2016-02-24 11:55:13	reisio	so you could mill something from a 3d model for me?
2016-02-24 11:55:17	haxmeister	reisio, but locally people know my hobbies and occationally I earn a few bucks or some brownie points for applying it
2016-02-24 11:55:25	haxmeister	reisio, probably
2016-02-24 11:55:56	reisio	getting into 3d milling is pretty high on my once-life-is-easier todo list
2016-02-24 11:56:16	reisio	far saner than 3d printing, IMO, in quite a lot of ways
2016-02-24 11:56:31	haxmeister	reisio, it's a no brainer for me.. about 20yrs doing it thus far
2016-02-24 11:56:48	reisio	it makes more sense to me, for example
2016-02-24 11:56:57	reisio	to take a piece of wood (or whatever), and mill it into what you want
2016-02-24 11:57:12	reisio	vs putting a million things into a blender and squeezing them out of an anus to print into what you want
2016-02-24 11:57:21	haxmeister	lol
2016-02-24 11:57:25	reisio	you agree?
2016-02-24 11:57:54	Digit	since i saw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk3A41U0iO4 i agree that 3d milling our own toys is the future.
2016-02-24 11:58:01	Digit	s/toys/tools/
2016-02-24 11:58:05	reisio	although I guess I wouldn't personally want to limit it to milling strictly

2016-02-24 11:58:21	reisio	you could after all shape wood mechnically without rotary whittling
2016-02-24 11:58:50	Digit	oh for librecad to get some 3d savvy
2016-02-24 11:58:52	reisio	well I mean, you can cut down a tree (that you grew, sustainably), and mill it

2016-02-24 11:59:02	Digit	i'm not ready to do 3d modeling in emacs!
2016-02-24 11:59:03	reisio	you can't do that with modern widespread plastics
2016-02-24 11:59:29	reisio	Digit: hah, this has a good start
2016-02-24 12:00:02	Digit	reisio: no reason to rule that possibility out alltogether though.  some hemp, some clever cracking n whatnot, bam, grow your own bio-plastics.
2016-02-24 12:00:22	reisio	yeah of course
2016-02-24 12:00:27	reisio	Ford had his hemp plastic car way back when
2016-02-24 12:00:35	reisio	it's still absurdly hard to legally farm hemp in the USA, for example
2016-02-24 12:00:43	reisio	even when marijuana is more and more legal
2016-02-24 12:00:58	reisio	canada is close, but that's a different country
2016-02-24 12:01:28	reisio	with hemp I'd want to get into vertical farming, too
2016-02-24 12:01:30	Digit	any most of the world.   there's incumberances n impediments to hemp proliferation everywhere.  tis "the competition" to too many industry
2016-02-24 12:01:37	reisio	taking up all the land with farming is also absurd :D
2016-02-24 12:01:47	reisio	well it's silly, particularly in the USA
2016-02-24 12:01:51	reisio	hemp was huge for WWII
2016-02-24 12:02:05	reisio	and again, marijuana being legalized everywhere
2016-02-24 12:02:15	reisio	my understanding is that you just plain cannot really get high on hemp
2016-02-24 12:02:28	reisio	and even if you could, who would bother when the crazy bred-for-brain-destruction stuff is legal more and more
2016-02-24 12:03:03	Digit	i quite like the idea of underground farming...  with efficient led, n the right spectrum's to fire off photosynthesis, at the optimal refresh rate for further efficiencies... no reason to not do so, powered by solar!  even with the relative inefficiencies of converting lums to volts.  ^_^
2016-02-24 12:03:09	reisio	programmatic 3d modelling, nom nom
2016-02-24 12:03:19	Digit	whole huge swathes of abandoned mines doing nothing
2016-02-24 12:03:27	reisio	yeah...
2016-02-24 12:03:36	reisio	I thought about that
2016-02-24 12:03:38	reisio	it worries me a little
2016-02-24 12:03:44	reisio	important things are kept under the ground
2016-02-24 12:03:57	reisio	whereas the creatures of the air don't usually begrudge another place to sit and crap from
2016-02-24 12:04:12	reisio	I'm guessing underwater would also work great
2016-02-24 12:04:25	reisio	there are after all essentially deserts here and there in the ocean
2016-02-24 12:04:31	reisio	just empty unused space, for the most part
2016-02-24 12:04:42	reisio	though if you built something there we'd probably notice quickly that they weren't actually empty :p
2016-02-24 12:04:56	reisio	there's always extra-terrestrial farming, though
2016-02-24 12:05:16	reisio	AIUI plants do crazy things when exposed to a little extra solar radiation
2016-02-24 12:05:16	Digit	antartica pretty big.   what it doing?  besides being a big UV hole, and vast area to hide the secret bunkers and rocket hangers. ^_^
2016-02-24 12:05:42	reisio	IIRC the chinese sent fruit and veggie seeds up into space and when they grew them later on they produced /CRAZY LARGE/ fruits
2016-02-24 12:05:52	reisio	yeah...
2016-02-24 12:05:57	reisio	antarctica...
2016-02-24 12:06:01	reisio	is problematic for political reasons
2016-02-24 12:06:18	Digit	should get those lazy penguins doing something...  then with a job to do, and trained up for, they wouldnt huddle around doing nothing all the time.
2016-02-24 12:06:18	reisio	as soon as it's a little warmer there, people will fight over its land
2016-02-24 12:06:33	reisio	and in the meantime you can't claim much of it, because the big guys have all these treaties
2016-02-24 12:06:42	Digit	meh.  spaceships for everyone.
2016-02-24 12:06:42		[12:06]
2016-02-24 12:06:46	reisio	what I'd really like is to find a nice unused bit of the sahara
2016-02-24 12:06:55	reisio	preferably away from where the French did their nuclear testing
2016-02-24 12:07:02	reisio	or central Australian desert
2016-02-24 12:07:10	Digit	i cant be bothered with playing along with the manufactured scarcity any more.  enough's enough.  ^_^
2016-02-24 12:07:11	reisio	...also preferably away from where the English did /their/ nuclear testing
2016-02-24 12:07:27	reisio	manufactured scarcity?
2016-02-24 12:07:58	Digit	like planned obsolecense, n other forms of profitable supression.
2016-02-24 12:08:31	Digit	heh, like proprietary software. ^_^
2016-02-24 12:08:45	reisio	you mean like how people think we're running out of water and land?
2016-02-24 12:08:50	reisio	when really we just have too many people? :p
2016-02-24 12:09:18	reisio	the great upcoming famines will sort that out, shame we have to wait
2016-02-24 12:09:26	reisio	wow
2016-02-24 12:09:29	reisio	coffee is doing its thing
2016-02-24 12:09:31	Digit	ugh.  too many people for what?  for the space n resources?  we're in an ever expanding universe.  look up.   ample.   abundant.  spaceships for everyone.  no need for a cull.
2016-02-24 12:09:37	*	reisio answers the phone with nature on the line
2016-02-24 12:09:48	reisio	Digit: oh yeah, that too
2016-02-24 12:09:55	reisio	extraterrestrial mining will be big
2016-02-24 12:10:15	reisio	and it's... fairly hard to consider who will miss, for example, a barren rock in space that's made of thoroughly useful materials
2016-02-24 12:10:19	Digit	maybe.  depends how much of a handle we all get on free energy and energ-matter conversion
2016-02-24 12:10:20	reisio	not impossible, but fairly hard
2016-02-24 12:10:30	reisio	shitload of carbon out there $
2016-02-24 12:10:41	reisio	eh
2016-02-24 12:10:48	reisio	free energy would be nice, but we honestly don't need it
2016-02-24 12:10:49	reisio	for the same reason
2016-02-24 12:10:51	haxmeister	reisio, do you do 3D modeling then?
2016-02-24 12:10:55	reisio	we don't have too little energy, we have too many people
2016-02-24 12:11:04	reisio	haxmeister: no, not regularly, I've only dabbled
2016-02-24 12:11:11	Digit	too many people again?   for what?
2016-02-24 12:11:16	reisio	played with shapeways stuff a bit
2016-02-24 12:11:23	reisio	Digit: for the resources easily exploited
2016-02-24 12:11:31	haxmeister	reisio, I've been thinking about making a simple thermal generator using the seeback effect
2016-02-24 12:11:33	reisio	that is: those at hand, on this planet
2016-02-24 12:11:36	reisio	for now :p
2016-02-24 12:11:44	haxmeister	reisio, I can machine the parts after hours at work :-D
2016-02-24 12:12:08	Digit	says those who seek to profit from the perception that the resources are scarce and precious
2016-02-24 12:12:17	reisio	haxmeister: what's the roadblock in making energy that way?
2016-02-24 12:12:37	haxmeister	reisio, efficiency
2016-02-24 12:12:42	reisio	Digit: I'm sure those people say it, too
2016-02-24 12:12:55	reisio	haxmeister: so not enough to satisfy the needs of the current population? :p
2016-02-24 12:13:13	reisio	(^ again, plenty of free energy, just not for the number of people we presently have)
2016-02-24 12:13:14	haxmeister	reisio, depends on how you define "needs" I guess
2016-02-24 12:13:20	reisio	yeah
2016-02-24 12:13:32	Digit	every decade the water powered car has been (re)-"invented".    *shrug*   so if there's a resource we're short on, it's whatever it is that prevents those types of suppressive industrial espionage.  ^_^
2016-02-24 12:13:47	haxmeister	I'm sure I could build one to charge a car battery with minimal expense
2016-02-24 12:13:48	reisio	agreed, we aren't short on resources
2016-02-24 12:14:04	reisio	I'd say a water powered mass transit system would be better, though :)
2016-02-24 12:14:06	Digit	cept wisdom perhaps.

2016-02-24 13:13:00	michaelrose	it would be nice to have a chrome or chromium binary package like the firefox one
2016-02-24 13:16:19	reisio	google-chrome-stable/beta, no?
2016-02-24 13:16:24	reisio	like that on Gentoo, at least
2016-02-24 13:16:59	michaelrose	oh I really should have looked at the ebuild
2016-02-24 13:17:13	michaelrose	looks like it just gets the deb
2016-02-24 13:17:27	reisio	:D
2016-02-24 13:17:39	reisio	I think since there's google-chrome, and it's /only/ binary
2016-02-24 13:17:47	reisio	they forego the chromium-bin you might otherwise expect to exist
2016-02-24 13:17:55	michaelrose	I thought all binary packages were postfixed with -bin
2016-02-24 13:18:02	michaelrose	but that is not a good assumption
2016-02-24 13:18:07	reisio	it's only for disambiguating, yeah
2016-02-24 13:18:14	reisio	like 'opera' has never had a -bin
2016-02-24 13:18:19	reisio	because it's only ever been binary
2016-02-24 13:18:31	reisio	perhaps non-ideal, but binaries are in general, so
2016-02-24 13:18:36	*	reisio sups

2016-02-26 01:59:18	fs0ciety	you could try reinstalling app-portage/portage-utils and sys-apps/portage
2016-02-26 01:59:29	fs0ciety	sys-apps/portage probably has the python module :)

2016-02-26 02:10:59	shamus397	mine is set to 3.4
2016-02-26 02:11:27	MinceR	angry_vincent: if the blue asterisk means default, i have 2.7
2016-02-26 02:11:36	shamus397	hmm, i have an update to portage-utils. trying that.
2016-02-26 02:11:54	@angry_vincent	MinceR: show all available pythons
2016-02-26 02:12:04	MinceR	i have 2.7, 3.3, 2.4

2016-02-26 02:13:23	MinceR	i can't copy/paste from there yet (running in a vm), but it would reinstall app-admin/ego-1.0.1

2016-02-26 02:14:38	shamus397	mine just shows that it wants to reinstall ego-1.0.1 by itself
2016-02-26 02:14:42	xemacs	update worked for me. no help needed ;)
2016-02-26 02:14:49	shamus397	(the update of portage-utils did not work for me)
2016-02-26 02:19:30	shamus397	it seems that 3.4 is masked somehow in PYTHON_TARGETS: https://bpaste.net/show/def613021a2f
2016-02-26 02:20:13	@angry_vincent	it shouldn't be masked
2016-02-26 02:20:19	@angry_vincent	unless its masked on your box
2016-02-26 02:20:41	shamus397	maybe i need to sync. just a few minutes...
2016-02-26 02:22:00	@angry_vincent	MinceR: it looks like you got your pythons update, but portage is not rebuilt against them

2016-02-26 02:41:59	shamus397	you might want to set it to 3.4
2016-02-26 02:42:00	MinceR	i think it's python2.7
2016-02-26 02:42:00	@angry_vincent	MinceR: you sure python2.7 is set as default?

2016-02-26 02:43:53	MinceR	i guess that means it's the default

2016-02-26 02:46:55	@angry_vincent	so, this is the problem
2016-02-26 02:46:59	MinceR	indeed

2016-02-26 02:47:52	@angry_vincent	yes, he is right, but epro imports protage that is built with python3.3.
2016-02-26 02:48:29	@angry_vincent	correction, portage no longer built with 3.3

2016-02-26 03:35:21	@angry_vincent	librin: ok, you need also enable ndk module
2016-02-26 03:35:48	@angry_vincent	librin: it's needed for encrypted_session
2016-02-26 03:36:05	@angry_vincent	maybe ebuild needs REQUIRED_USE check
2016-02-26 03:37:21	tyil	I'm trying to use zfs, following the guide here: http://www.funtoo.org/ZFS_Install_Guide. Im at the part where I need to `zpool status`, but it complains /dev/zfs doesn't exist, however, when I check `ls /dev/zfs` it reports this file does actually exist
2016-02-26 03:38:05	tyil	does anyone have experience with zfs on funtoo in here?
2016-02-26 03:38:24	reisio	what's ndk for?

2016-02-26 04:55:50	reisio	I doubt emerge -cav python:3.3 is part of the install process
2016-02-26 04:55:58	reisio	some reason you're running that?
2016-02-26 04:56:06	MinceR	165340 <@angry_vincent> unmerge of python3.3 might fix it
2016-02-26 04:56:40	reisio	he probably meant -C/--unmerge
2016-02-26 04:56:50	@angry_vincent	MinceR: what emerge -1vat $(find /usr/lib*/python3* -name '*cpython-3[3-5].so')
2016-02-26 04:56:53	@angry_vincent	MinceR: gives
2016-02-26 04:59:00	MinceR	it would reinstall cython-0.22, pyxattr-0.5.5, python-3.3.5-r2:3.3, python-3.4.3-r1:3.4
2016-02-26 04:59:35	MinceR	cythn and pyxattr have -python3_3 in their PYTHON_TARGETS, not sure if this is an issue
2016-02-26 04:59:45	@angry_vincent	ah, you didn't remove python3.3
2016-02-26 04:59:55	MinceR	i haven't tried to -C it yet

2016-02-26 08:00:09	nethawk	Hello everyone. I've recently bought a chromebook pixel as it seemed a good development device. I'd like to put funtoo on it, but can't seem to get started. I've got experience with BIOS based machines, not so much with EFI and this seems to have some special things on top of that. Wondering if anyone got experience
2016-02-26 08:01:36	nethawk	Currently the most important question for me: Do I need to disable write protection in hardware and software to be sure that the boot_usb and seaBIOS flags stay?
2016-02-26 08:02:43	nethawk	I am refering to this for help:

2016-02-26 16:56:19	firefish5000	anyone have a sugestion for reading funtoo news. It's been a while, and the rss news feed is still down. And visiting the page requires me to remmember to check, which I don't do.
2016-02-26 16:57:23	firefish5000	I have conky, cron, etc. Is there a parser already written to display them?

2016-02-26 16:59:49	firefish5000	I haven't read/learned much since funtoo switched off eselect news(which I don't think was in the news), ~2yrs ago.
2016-02-26 17:03:00	firefish5000	oh  wait, its up. Sorry!
2016-02-26 17:05:04	firefish5000	Or is it? a funtoo thing appeared, but it doen't look like news. Guess its still down and liferea found another feed and went for it. clicking the atom link gives 404.

2016-02-26 19:15:35	firefish5000	my new install was using the new nic naming scheme /dev/enp1s0 or alike, but switched to the old as soon as I rebooted. How do I get the new scheme back, other than manualy changing the name in udev?

2016-02-26 22:51:17	firefish5000	as some sort of last resort, you could use a VM. QEMU with your hdmi card passed through (probably VGA passthrough). And then get sound by steaming all audio into the vm, which wil be running windows and passing the sound out using windows drivers
2016-02-26 22:52:07	firefish5000	Or WINE with windows drivers. I have heard of a few making that work, I think....
2016-02-26 22:52:53	firefish5000	or write drivers yourself. though you might want to doublecheck that an existing driver doesn't work first
2016-02-26 22:55:13	firefish5000	if your card is recent, then I can definitly see problems. But if it is a little on the old side, this http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/ sometimes helps me.

2016-02-27 07:15:15	reisio	so by suggesting 'gnome' instead of 'dconf', his killed the question
2016-02-27 07:15:33	reisio	'dbus' already existed as a USE flag, it does other things, AFAIK
2016-02-27 07:15:47	reisio	so to disable this properly one has to determine which packages are GNOMEy first, and then disable 'dbus' only for those
2016-02-27 07:15:49	reisio	which is a huge PITA
2016-02-27 07:15:58	reisio	anybody else agree it should be named 'dconf'?
2016-02-27 07:17:36	Renich	angry_vincent: Just the logging config; set to WARN
2016-02-27 07:17:59	reisio	actually I think the flag itself is invalid
2016-02-27 07:18:06	reisio	dbus? ( dconf ) makes no sense
2016-02-27 07:18:14	reisio	dconf is _not_ required for settings, it is optional for settings
2016-02-27 07:18:29	reisio	gsettings has at least 3 interfaces, dconf being only one of them
2016-02-27 07:20:50	reisio	I have dconf in package.provided, and everything works
2016-02-27 07:20:58	reisio	I'm now using package.provided as a USE flag
2016-02-27 07:21:02	reisio	this seems wrong :p

2016-02-27 07:40:47	reisio	talking to bonsaikitten
2016-02-27 07:41:07	reisio	he's informative, but isn't willing to take on the entire gnome herd, as he perceives it
2016-02-27 07:41:18	reisio	I don't really blame him, but it would've been nice :p
2016-02-27 07:42:24	javaJake	reisio: if you file a bug, that's a little more democratic
2016-02-27 07:42:45	biberao	reisio: bonsaikitten must be the best gentoo cat
2016-02-27 07:42:46	reisio	there already is a bug
2016-02-27 07:42:52	reisio	and bonsaikitten even partially opposed it
2016-02-27 07:42:59	reisio	but he only nullified its ill effects for server people
2016-02-27 07:43:01	reisio	not for Xfce people
2016-02-27 07:43:45	javaJake	reisio: you could patch the ebuild, and file a bug for Funtoo.

2016-02-27 07:44:20	reisio	I don't use Funtoo :)
2016-02-27 07:44:26	reisio	if it comes up here I'll inform someone of the root cause, though
2016-02-27 07:44:31	javaJake	Oh my bad
2016-02-27 07:44:43	reisio	I'll put it into gentoo's Xfce wiki page, though
2016-02-27 07:45:19	reisio	I'm guessing it'll only be an issue for desktop users (not server installs), and only for those not already using GNOME or KDE
2016-02-27 07:45:29	reisio	which is a lot of people, but probably not the majority
2016-02-27 07:46:31	javaJake	If I were in your shoes on Gentoo I'd write an ebuild and then mask ::gentoo for that ebuild
2016-02-27 07:46:37	javaJake	Or mask dconf

2016-02-27 08:18:58	javaJake	MinceR: personally I only add USE flags I really care about (vim-syntax, networkmanager, pulseaudio, spell, and a few others) and leave most things for per-package. Sometimes flags come with consequences that are specific to a package.

2016-02-27 08:35:24	reisio	MinceR: yes indeed
2016-02-27 08:35:47	reisio	MinceR: it's hard work to choose all your flags during installation
2016-02-27 08:35:55	reisio	it's simpler to choose them _as_ you install _specific packages_
2016-02-27 08:36:11	reisio	I also personally favor package-specific package.use over global make.conf USE=
2016-02-27 08:36:24	reisio	you might after all want flac support for a specific music/audio application
2016-02-27 08:36:29	reisio	and not for many other things that have optional flac support

2016-02-27 08:37:44	reisio	I don't think so, actually
2016-02-27 08:37:46	reisio	but it's easily tested
2016-02-27 08:37:54	reisio	portage will complain if you add something it doesn't like, just try it

2016-03-01 10:27:29	scratchula	3rd Gentoo/Funtoo fail, I got a lot further in Funtoo though, good kernel seed I guess. I just never got to GUI and couldn't diagnose a missing make.conf and other things.
2016-03-01 10:28:11	scratchula	Do you still need to emerge Debian kernel if you used the kernel seed, (I'm sandy bridge)
2016-03-01 10:31:05	shamus397	the latest stage 3's come with a pre-built debian kernel
2016-03-01 10:38:21	scratchula	so I'd still have to emerge it then following the instructions, What about missing make.conf in /etc/portage/ ? normal?
2016-03-01 10:38:59	scratchula	I'll have to try again later, I'm not on the system anymore, partimage restored my windows, albiet with corrupted MBR, I was able to fix it though.
2016-03-01 10:41:29	scratchula	I think I have to pay attention more to the non terminal parts where they say edit so and so txt. Should I still be using grub then? I think I had more luck with lilo in the past, I guess it's no longer being worked on.

2016-03-01 10:43:34	PaddyMac	<groan> Has anyone had any issues since the update yesterday? Glibc was updated, so that's my prime suspect.

2016-03-01 10:45:22	lautriv_	scratchula, blank make.conf is usual in new stages, most defaults are set by arch/subarch/flavor nevertheless you can place values there.
2016-03-01 10:45:25	PaddyMac	I guess I just jumped to conclusions. There's usually some hiccups with glibc updates, so I figured for sure that was the cause.
2016-03-01 10:46:26	PaddyMac	Ooh. revdep-rebuild has been updated. Fancy!
2016-03-01 10:47:06	PaddyMac	Nevermind me. I'm exhausted and probably on the edge of being slightly delusional from lack of sleep.
2016-03-01 10:48:33	lautriv_	PaddyMac, lack of sleep is a good reason ;)
2016-03-01 10:49:10	lautriv_	<- just went back because can't get sleep.
2016-03-01 10:51:59	scratchula	lautriv I did all the flavor stuff though, funny everything seemed good except I could never get to a GUI.

2016-03-01 14:35:46	PaddyMac	What's the best firewall to set up for someone who has no experience setting up a firewall but needs to set one up in short order?
2016-03-01 14:36:25	PaddyMac	I realize it comes down mostly to iptables or netfilter, but I at least would like a good frontend to help make it easier.

2016-03-01 14:38:45	nodxine	PaddyMac, I only know this one { https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestarter_%28firewall%29 }
2016-03-01 14:38:53	PaddyMac	Well, I don't really need a complicated setup. I just want to close off all ports, except a few select ones, from the public internet.
2016-03-01 14:38:56	+_`_	iptables(8) is still netfilter
2016-03-01 14:39:18	PaddyMac	I thought netfilter superceded iptables.
2016-03-01 14:39:23	+_`_	nftables does
2016-03-01 14:39:28	PaddyMac	Oh.

2016-03-01 14:47:26	PaddyMac	There's probably no way around a good bit of doc reading on this one. I'd hoped I'd have a break after all the reading I had to do to get a Hiawatha reverse proxy set up.

2016-03-01 15:07:30	PaddyMac	I'm going to try ufw. It seems simple enough.
2016-03-01 15:07:40	PaddyMac	It's a frontend to netfilter.
2016-03-01 15:11:24	+_`_	I'll be a TUI frontend to netfilter one day.
2016-03-01 15:11:34	+_`_	but for now sleep

Is there something i can install to fix this differently? https://0.jmt.gr/?d7ce5e2cc89c7634#B515YK43CiqTY/6iZu5IrJlpsMkC6Q564E331kj7JKQ=
2016-03-01 22:06:24	alice_wl	I have python2.7 in eselect. wonder if I should switch to 3.4

2016-03-02 02:21:00	javaJake	I was just reading an article from Hacker News about bitcoin. It's sad that a promising experiment of decentralized resource sharing is imploding so violently. :(
2016-03-02 02:22:41	PaddyMac	I'll have to check out the article

2016-03-02 02:24:00	javaJake	Also, this guy was saying the same things earlier this year, albeit with more conspiracy flavor: https://medium.com/@octskyward/the-resolution-of-the-bitcoin-experiment-dabb30201f7

2016-03-02 02:26:03	PaddyMac	Thanks for the link. I Googled "Hacker News". I didn't realize just how many places call themselves "The Hacker News".
2016-03-02 02:26:57	PaddyMac	I imagine that the fact that bitcoin has increasingly become the currency of choice for illegal activities hasn't helped matters.
2016-03-02 02:27:40	PaddyMac	Though I think that was certainly foreseeable.

2016-03-02 02:41:34	javaJake	MinceR: the big news in the US at least hasn't been that it's been used for illegal activities but that it's used at all by investors as a tax-free investment. I don't think the US is interested in anything more than making sure it's treated the same as other currencies.

2016-03-02 02:52:51	javaJake	They don't get pulled during a regular world update because they're not needed for runtime.

2016-03-02 08:45:00	nethawk	Hello folks, I'm trying to install funtoo on the chromebook pixel 2015. I've just made a full back up, just in case, and am now ready to make the partitions. But looking at gdisk output I see a few partitions with odd names, most notably: EFI-SYSTEM and RWFW and am wondering if these have anything to do with the firmware and EFI system of this machine and if deleting them is a bad idea?
2016-03-02 08:50:32	javaJake	nethawk: can't say for sure, but you can leave those partitions and install Funtoo in a third partition I'd imagine.
2016-03-02 08:50:53	nethawk	there's 12 of 'em already :)

2016-03-02 08:53:17	nethawk	lol, I didn't know until now. It's a great machine so I'm willing to go the extra mile, removed the firmware protection and set seaBIOS as default and put the firmware write protection back in :)
2016-03-02 08:53:38	nethawk	now at the partitioning, and then openvz on top :)

2016-03-02 10:01:47	reisio	what's it look like, question marks or boxes with alphanums?
2016-03-02 10:02:15	saptech	yea that's how it looks on FF, but in this hexchat window, it look like oriental writing

2016-03-02 10:05:13	+_`_	nethawk: typically it shouldn't make a difference. I don't know what your chromebook's efi implementation, which might be a bit of an oddball, expects on the other hand.

2016-03-02 11:46:47	saptech	Arfrever, so add Uniaika, line and then run our last command?
2016-03-02 11:47:14	saptech	your*
2016-03-02 11:47:24	Arfrever	saptech: Is net-misc/dropbox in /var/lib/portage/world ?
2016-03-02 11:48:15	saptech	yep
2016-03-02 11:49:55	Arfrever	saptech: emerge -Cav net-misc/dropbox ; emerge -atv1 sys-libs/ncurses:5 ; emerge -atv net-misc/dropbox
2016-03-02 11:50:56	Arfrever	saptech: The second command should suggest installation of sys-libs/ncurses-5.9-r101.
2016-03-02 11:51:11	saptech	ok
2016-03-02 11:51:37	Arfrever	saptech: If it is suggesting anything else, then there is mistake in package.mask.

2016-03-02 11:56:07	Arfrever	saptech: dropbox is already uninstalled?
2016-03-02 11:56:32	saptech	yes, I forgot to add the other line in package.mask

2016-03-02 11:59:33	saptech	ok I added the line to package.mask and then ran the install ncurses-5, but it will add some other packages with it
2016-03-02 12:00:01	saptech	some emac & xemac packages
2016-03-02 12:00:07	saptech	is that normal?

2016-03-02 12:01:54	saptech	ok
2016-03-02 12:02:00	Arfrever	saptech: There is a package called app-xemacs/emerge
2016-03-02 12:02:11	saptech	yes
2016-03-02 12:02:15	Arfrever	saptech: So 'emerge emerge' would install this package.
2016-03-02 12:02:22	saptech	ok
2016-03-02 12:02:34	saptech	why does it want it? just curious
2016-03-02 12:02:55	Arfrever	saptech: Because you wrote 'emerge' twice :) .

2016-03-02 12:05:55	saptech	thats better
2016-03-02 12:06:14	saptech	so having two emerge command, why did it pick xemac?
2016-03-02 12:07:06	Arfrever	saptech: It was one emerge command with emerge argument treated as name of package.

2016-03-02 12:14:48	Arfrever	saptech: There is only one package "emerge" in repository, which is "app-xemacs/emerge".
2016-03-02 12:15:10	saptech	ok

2016-03-02 12:21:05	Atomic_RCfUo	hey fellas, just seeing what the difference is between this and gentoo really... is funtoo just more optimizing?

2016-03-02 12:22:49	sandro_	Hi ..
2016-03-02 12:23:39	Atomic_RCfUo	yo
2016-03-02 12:24:23	reisio	Atomic_RCfUo: Funtoo is still dependent on Gentoo, so the differences are in small development changes
2016-03-02 12:24:24	sandro_	Hi Atomic_RCFUo :)
2016-03-02 12:24:36	reisio	particular builds, more specific profiles, mixins
2016-03-02 12:24:42	reisio	new software for portage
2016-03-02 12:25:05	reisio	Funtoo used git for the tree before Gentoo, though I'm not really sure where I come down on that
2016-03-02 12:25:33	sandro_	reisio: Gentoo uses rsync
2016-03-02 12:25:41	Atomic_RCfUo	ah. is it possible to move a gen install to fun install?
2016-03-02 12:25:47	reisio	and you could argue drobbins' presence is not nothing
2016-03-02 12:26:14	Atomic_RCfUo	or do you just need to start fresh?
2016-03-02 12:26:17	reisio	Atomic_RCfUo: I don't see why not, but it'd probably be simpler to quickpkg to binaries, then reinstall, then emerge -K
2016-03-02 12:26:45	reisio	sandro_: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6vs0mKF7AyLaUs5NWVSUmVGZHM/edit?pref=2&pli=1
2016-03-02 12:28:08	sandro_	Thanks reisio .... now i've installed the ffmulticonferter from sources; but i'd like to learn how to create an ebuild ....
2016-03-02 12:28:14	Atomic_RCfUo	yeah probably. I'll look into it. I'm just tired of some of the ops in gentoo that have the God simplex. really want to get away from that
2016-03-02 12:28:45	reisio	sandro_: https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ #gentoo-dev-help https://dev.gentoo.org/~ulm/pms/head/pms.html
2016-03-02 12:29:04	Atomic_RCfUo	I've been with the distro 10+ years easy. put my foot down a day or so ago and I'm done with the bs
2016-03-02 12:29:08	reisio	Atomic_RCfUo: I can sympathize, but any community, given enough time, will almost certainly turn out that way
2016-03-02 12:29:29	Atomic_RCfUo	yeah
2016-03-02 12:29:39	reisio	it took a while, but I finally figured out how to deal with power hungry ops
2016-03-02 12:29:47	reisio	it's reaaallllyyyy simple
2016-03-02 12:29:54	reisio	ignore them
2016-03-02 12:29:58	Atomic_RCfUo	I'm debating about moving to arch
2016-03-02 12:30:07	reisio	they always have it in their heads that your next _response_ will be the magical line-crossing response
2016-03-02 12:30:12	reisio	so just ignore them :p
2016-03-02 12:31:01	sandro_	Ok Dear reisio: now are ~ 02:30 am in my town ... but i'd like to learn; thank you very much for your links. i want to learn more and more about *too :P so also can give an handfor this project :P
2016-03-02 12:31:15	Atomic_RCfUo	doesn't work well with me. I pretty much got banned from all #gentoo channels foot telling the op to go f himself because GCC was throwing an error in gentoo but yet it wasn't on topic? whatever
2016-03-02 12:31:37	reisio	Atomic_RCfUo: I get it
2016-03-02 12:31:45	reisio	I got banned from #gentoo when I _was_ an op
2016-03-02 12:31:52	reisio	but all channels are like that eventually
2016-03-02 12:31:57	reisio	until I make the IRC network without ops
2016-03-02 12:32:04	Atomic_RCfUo	lol still banned?
2016-03-02 12:32:22	reisio	mmm, ATM this nick is still banned, it's been unbanned and rebanned a few times since that ban
2016-03-02 12:32:50	reisio	I go in there with another nick when I cbf
2016-03-02 12:33:04	Atomic_RCfUo	I'll think about it. thanks for your input. hell I may give mint Linux a try
2016-03-02 12:33:23	reisio	you're outta control :p
2016-03-02 12:33:32	Atomic_RCfUo	lol
2016-03-02 12:33:35	Atomic_RCfUo	I know
2016-03-02 12:33:49	sandro_	Atomic_RCFUo: There are differences also in the "infrastructure" of the OS then i think it is better to make a fresh installation
2016-03-02 12:33:58	reisio	invariably ops start thinking they're an op as a privilege and not as a service :p happens with any power structure
2016-03-02 12:34:16	reisio	that's why in ancient greece you had a single term and then someone else had their turn
2016-03-02 12:35:19	Atomic_RCfUo	yeah. anyway I gatta run, hussy is giving me the stink eye
2016-03-02 12:35:55	reisio	heh
2016-03-02 12:35:56	sandro_	reisio: excuse me ...... I've installed 3 Funtoo "Stable" and are better than Gentoo cause in Funtoo is solved the trouble about "users-switch" ....
2016-03-02 12:36:00	reisio	talkin' about women in #linux, too :p
2016-03-02 12:36:09	reisio	sandro_: users-switch?
2016-03-02 12:36:23	sandro_	at this moment (i've installed both) Funtoo > Gentoo :P
2016-03-02 12:37:04	sandro_	reisio: yes ... i reported the bug and in Funtoo is solved in Gentoo is still present (with nvidia-drivers latest)
2016-03-02 12:37:11	reisio	sandro_: what bug?
2016-03-02 12:37:53	sandro_	reisio: https://bugs.funtoo.org/browse/FL-3132
2016-03-02 12:38:21	sandro_	Now Funtoo works fine; Gentoo still have the trouble (at today)
2016-03-02 12:39:22	reisio	bug doesn't make any more sense to me than what you said, I'm afraid
2016-03-02 12:41:00	sandro_	reisio: why ? if i've made errors excuse me .... :|

2016-03-03 02:04:51	ko1	Hello, on my server, I have a staticly configured network interface (eth0, template="interface") and up until now it worked perfectly. But now, I'm asked to change the gateway to something on another subnet. I can add the gateway manually with "ip addr add default via x.x.x.x dev eth0 onlink" but I don't see where to add this "onlink" in /etc/conf.d/net.eth0 Could someone help me please?
2016-03-03 02:04:55	 - 	ko1 is now known as ko
2016-03-03 02:08:41	@angry_vincent	asked by who?

2016-03-03 02:09:24	ko	yup
2016-03-03 02:10:07	@angry_vincent	ok, i thought it is asked during update or something
2016-03-03 02:12:06	+_`_	you're adding a gateway that the kernel shouldn't be doing a consistency check on?
2016-03-03 02:12:33	+_`_	(afaik that's pretty much what “onlink” does)
2016-03-03 02:12:37	ko	yes
2016-03-03 02:12:41	+_`_	ugh.
2016-03-03 02:13:43	+_`_	You might have to modify the template yourself to add that argument to ip(8).
2016-03-03 02:13:56	ko	(I didn't even knew it was possible until today :-s)
2016-03-03 02:14:12	+_`_	but I'd modify it as a distinct name
2016-03-03 02:14:18	@angry_vincent	current scripts does not have support for onlink
2016-03-03 02:14:28	@angry_vincent	but its probably not hard to add

2016-03-03 02:22:26	+_`_	tough to cleanly add though
2016-03-03 02:26:48	+_`_	ko: the gateway is set in /etc/init.d/netif.tmpl, you can copy that to /etc/init.d/netif.$interfacename (replacing a prior symlink) and append “onlink” the the appropriate line (L271).
2016-03-03 02:27:06	ko	(wow, I should not write command from memory on IRC… It should have been "ip route add" in my first message…)
2016-03-03 02:27:13	ko	_`_: thank you :)
2016-03-03 02:27:56	+_`_	oh wait nvm
2016-03-03 02:29:36	+_`_	nah, it's the ugly quick way to do it, but if you're in a rush, can't be helped.

2016-03-03 16:05:31	reisio	isn't that what the funtoo tree attempts to do already?
2016-03-03 16:05:42	@angry_vincent	right
2016-03-03 16:05:49	fs0ciety	I WANT UPDATES NOW ;)
2016-03-03 16:06:01	fs0ciety	i have an update issue
2016-03-03 16:06:01	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-03 16:06:36	reisio	that is definitely an issue on Funtoo
2016-03-03 16:06:44	@angry_vincent	what issue?
2016-03-03 16:06:52	reisio	but it's also an issue on Gentoo, from another POV
2016-03-03 16:07:01	reisio	angry_vincent: Gentoo updates not yet being on Funtoo, sometimes on purpose
2016-03-03 16:07:11	reisio	feature/bug :)
2016-03-03 16:07:43	@angry_vincent	this does not help in understnading what fs0ciety problem is
2016-03-03 16:07:49	fs0ciety	hahahaha
2016-03-03 16:08:24	fs0ciety	i guess i'm just impatient waiting for git commits on non critical applications.  sometimes i end up just grabbing the ebuilds
2016-03-03 16:08:36	reisio	I'm presuming it's to do with somethin Gentoo already has, but Funtoo does not
2016-03-03 16:08:41	fs0ciety	correct
2016-03-03 16:08:45	reisio	which is a frequent thing people in here bring up
2016-03-03 16:08:49	fs0ciety	and sometimes git pushes can be a few days
2016-03-03 16:08:59	reisio	often without even being aware that the problem is Funtoo being out of sync with Gentoo
2016-03-03 16:09:12	reisio	(again, sometimes even Funtoo has done this on purpose)
2016-03-03 16:09:18	fs0ciety	oh i know funtoo is oos sometimes
2016-03-03 16:09:26	@angry_vincent	what is oos?
2016-03-03 16:09:30	reisio	out of sync, I guess
2016-03-03 16:09:31	fs0ciety	out of sync
2016-03-03 16:09:52	fs0ciety	and i know funtoo mask packages here and there for stability
2016-03-03 16:09:53	@angry_vincent	but what problem is expected to get fixed with sync?
2016-03-03 16:10:06	fs0ciety	and i must admit its more stable than gentoo
2016-03-03 16:10:14	@angry_vincent	oos is not a prblem if you getting no problem
2016-03-03 16:10:34	fs0ciety	as i said i'm just impatient, i grab ebuilds and putting them in my local overlay.. i never actually said i had a problem
2016-03-03 16:10:39	+_`_	he never said it was a problem, sounds like he just has shiny new software syndrome
2016-03-03 16:10:47	fs0ciety	EXACTLY
2016-03-03 16:10:49	fs0ciety	XD
2016-03-03 16:11:01	fs0ciety	i've had shiny new software syndrome for decades. haha
2016-03-03 16:11:03	@angry_vincent	well, he said i have an update problem
2016-03-03 16:11:08	@angry_vincent	but ok, i see now
2016-03-03 16:11:25	fs0ciety	i mean update issue as in "i have shiny new updates syndrome"
2016-03-03 16:11:30	fs0ciety	i was making fun of myself
2016-03-03 16:11:33	@angry_vincent	there will update very soon

2016-03-03 16:11:49	+_`_	what software do you want updated
2016-03-03 16:11:56	@angry_vincent	becuase openssl ABI thing
2016-03-03 16:12:06	fs0ciety	yeah i realised it was the openssl abi thing

2016-03-03 16:12:19	fs0ciety	only reason i asked my initial question is because i found the following. let me find the url
2016-03-03 16:12:39	reisio	it's a problem, whether fs0ciety considers it to be or not
2016-03-03 16:12:46	reisio	see it come up in here more than any other, really
2016-03-03 16:12:54	fs0ciety	https://github.com/matijaskala/funtoo-utils
2016-03-03 16:13:32	fs0ciety	reisio: it can be sometimes - i'd agree
2016-03-03 16:13:41	@angry_vincent	kensington: whats the deal with opencv-3.x
2016-03-03 16:13:51	reisio	interesting
2016-03-03 16:13:53	@angry_vincent	kensington: it needs for stabilization>
2016-03-03 16:13:55	@angry_vincent	kensington: ?
2016-03-03 16:14:08	reisio	fs0ciety: sure, but I'm just saying, your agreement is not required; it's an issue regardless
2016-03-03 16:14:15	@angry_vincent	kensington: i'm not quite followed opencv updates
2016-03-03 16:14:30	reisio	and I don't even use Funtoo, so it's not like I'm griping about it; it's something I hope they are aware of, for their own sakes alone
2016-03-03 16:15:07	fs0ciety	reisio: which is why i was wondering if somehow i could merge non critical apps from a general gentoo tree somehow into funtoo quicker
2016-03-03 16:15:44	reisio	layman, I'd imagine
2016-03-03 16:15:52	reisio	at least, I imagine the purpose of layman is to make using overlays easier
2016-03-03 16:15:57	reisio	can't say I've ever quite seen it that way :p
2016-03-03 16:16:02	@drobbins	ok, I moved to google DNS.
2016-03-03 16:16:03	+_`_	what you're already doing is probably the quickest/sanest way to go about it, cherry picking ebuilds from gentoo.
2016-03-03 16:16:12	reisio	I doubt it'd be very hard to write a quick shell script to grab anything from the Gentoo git
2016-03-03 16:16:14	@drobbins	please let me know how things go when you try to get to your container.
2016-03-03 16:16:16	+_`_	but whether YMMV

2016-03-04 02:33:38	javaJake	Morning..
2016-03-04 02:35:09	javaJake	fs0ciety: shiny new software syndrome is why I pull kde-overlay :p
2016-03-04 02:36:06	javaJake	fs0ciety: if you want to automate pulling certain packages, Funtoo publishes the scripts they use to sync the main tree. I automated funtoo-kde-overlay that way.
2016-03-04 02:36:18	javaJake	fs0ciety: then you can set your own sync frequency or sync on demand
2016-03-04 02:38:37	kensington	shiny!

2016-03-04 11:41:36	PaddyMac	Are there any tools to merge two patches into a single patch? Because some patches affect the same file(s) and while they could coexist, the second patch will always fail when applied separately.

2016-03-04 11:55:17	reisio	PaddyMac: I dare say if it were truly simple to merge the two, it would be just as simple to allow both to be applied, no? :D
2016-03-04 11:58:07	PaddyMac	Well, there are two patches in particular I had in mind: grsecurity and uksm. And someone (I can't remember who) in this channel said they had successfully applied both patches, but they had to manually merge them and that it was a pain.
2016-03-04 11:58:36	reisio	too bad they didn't make a new combined patch for you

2016-03-04 11:59:28	PaddyMac	It would be convenient. I did a Google search about merging patches, and a few things did come up, but I haven't read them yet. I've been reading some articles on Phoronix.
2016-03-04 12:00:14	PaddyMac	The 5 senses are the bottlenecks to the brain.
2016-03-04 12:01:19	PaddyMac	Or, more broadly, the body is a bottleneck to the mind.
2016-03-04 12:01:24	reisio	dunno why we waste time with computers
2016-03-04 12:02:02	PaddyMac	Are you waxing philosphical on me, reisio? Why do you say that?
2016-03-04 12:03:54	reisio	yup
2016-03-04 12:03:56	reisio	because I don't
2016-03-04 12:05:47	PaddyMac	Normally I'd enjoy a conversation of this nature, but I have somewhere to go. Remember your thoughts, and we'll discuss them when I'm available.

2016-03-06 06:58:27	michaelrose	having some issue getting the the 9999 package to work, I have a local overlay that works, I copied the ebuild from qt overlay but I can't seem to actually get portage to see it
2016-03-06 06:59:54	michaelrose	one oddity it appeared to originally be called vim-qt-99999999 which seemed odd I thought all packages that pulled from git were named packagename-9999
2016-03-06 07:01:44	michaelrose	is there a difference between naming schemes?
2016-03-06 07:02:57	michaelrose	apparantly I was just screwing it up by naming it 9999
2016-03-06 07:03:08	michaelrose	so thats an easy fix
2016-03-06 07:04:08	lautriv_	michaelrose, -9999 is "from git" so it is bound to "latest" instead a specific version.
2016-03-06 07:04:27	michaelrose	is there any difference between 9999 and 99999999
2016-03-06 07:04:35	reisio	michaelrose: if you have a package with a "version" like vim-qt-20150201
2016-03-06 07:04:41	reisio	then you need that many more 9's to compensate
2016-03-06 07:05:11	michaelrose	oh lol
2016-03-06 07:05:28	reisio	because 20000000 is still greater than 9999
2016-03-06 07:05:34	reisio	in a simple -gt test
2016-03-06 07:05:44	reisio	which is what's done
2016-03-06 07:05:48	michaelrose	thank you

2016-03-06 07:07:30	michaelrose	said patch was too late to have been picked up in the 20150201 version of vim-qt

2016-03-06 08:25:19	philipp__	@aenesidemus: Judging from your pastebin you have non-updated config-files. Fix that with dispatch-conf or etc-update first.

2016-03-07 12:15:13	reisio	Dutch_Master: you should be able to configure those, even to the point of disabling them, with 'mate-notification-properties'
2016-03-07 12:15:35	Dutch_Master	ok, I see. didn't know that
2016-03-07 12:15:52	reisio	there are more brutish ways of making them go away, but no need to go that far yet
2016-03-07 12:16:08	reisio	I think you might find that, configured more to your liking, you might actually like them
2016-03-07 12:16:14	reisio	change opacity, position, duration, etc.
2016-03-07 12:16:37	Dutch_Master	I'll see if I can get them to go away via the properties tool
2016-03-07 12:17:10	reisio	I'd start there, yup

2016-03-07 12:17:54	reisio	aha, then you might be using GNOME's
2016-03-07 12:17:58	reisio	which is obviously also not ideal
2016-03-07 12:18:01	Dutch_Master	not entirely unexpected, as I've removed notifications-deamon

2016-03-07 12:22:22	reisio	Dutch_Master: install mate-notification-daemon (with emerge -1)
2016-03-07 12:22:32	reisio	then mate-notification-properties should exist
2016-03-07 12:22:41	reisio	and you might not hate them as much, even
2016-03-07 12:23:19	Dutch_Master	nah, doubt that.
2016-03-07 12:23:29	Dutch_Master	here's ps aux: https://bpaste.net/show/a99badf8db11
2016-03-07 12:23:51	Dutch_Master	and yes, I did pipe it through grep for noti ;-P
2016-03-07 12:24:21	reisio	qfile /usr/libexec/notification-daemon
2016-03-07 12:24:44	reisio	could be something you're still running despite having unmerged it
2016-03-07 12:24:48	*	reisio hugs Unix
2016-03-07 12:25:15	reisio	anyway, I'd install mate-notification-daemon and configure it as you please
2016-03-07 12:25:22	Dutch_Master	ah, seems logical
2016-03-07 12:25:34	Dutch_Master	right, giving it a go now
2016-03-07 12:25:34	reisio	in the unlikely event it doesn't let you configure it as you please (including fully disabling), you can put mate-notification-daemon into package.provided
2016-03-07 12:25:54	Dutch_Master	ok, what does that do?

2016-03-07 12:25:57	reisio	as for /usr/libexec/notification-daemon, if it's from a package you've already unmerged, you can just kill the process
2016-03-07 12:26:23	Dutch_Master	ok, tried it using the PID, process didn't exist
2016-03-07 12:26:25	reisio	package.provided says "hello, emerge, I already have the packages listed here, or at least I'd prefer it if you pretended I already did, phanks!"
2016-03-07 12:26:30	reisio	might be gone already
2016-03-07 12:26:59	reisio	it's good for the very odd situation where you've manually installed a package outside of portage (not a great idea), and also just to trick portage into leaving you be (like this)
2016-03-07 12:27:29	Dutch_Master	right, I see. Usefull list ;-D

2016-03-07 12:31:37	Dutch_Master	4 themes, 4 positions, nothing else

2016-03-07 12:32:12	Dutch_Master	looks like package.provided is called for
2016-03-07 12:32:36	reisio	downer
2016-03-07 12:32:45	reisio	IIRC even Xfce's notifier allows you to disable them
2016-03-07 12:33:22	reisio	of course, this might be MATE showing its age/unmaintainedness, again

2016-03-07 12:35:24	 < 	Filosofem (~Jawmare@unaffiliated/jawmare) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2016-03-07 12:35:34	Dutch_Master	so, Mate it has to be
2016-03-07 12:36:05	reisio	oh I definitely see your reasoning
2016-03-07 12:36:22	reisio	but for me, had I been a GNOME user, I would probably have gone farther and switched to Xfce
2016-03-07 12:36:29	reisio	which has always done all the same things as GNOME 2, IME
2016-03-07 12:36:32	reisio	without betraying its users
2016-03-07 12:36:41	reisio	and without having maintenance issues
2016-03-07 12:37:00	Dutch_Master	fair enough
2016-03-07 12:37:16	reisio	I'm guessing you can disable those notifications, only they've hidden the pref outside the GUI, the dumbos
2016-03-07 12:37:22	reisio	hacks ftw anyway :p
2016-03-07 12:37:29	reisio	hard to beat a simple toggle in a plain text file for a fix
2016-03-07 12:37:38	Dutch_Master	fair chance of that, yes
2016-03-07 12:39:34	Dutch_Master	well, wildcards in package.provided aren't working, nor is a general name
2016-03-07 12:39:41	Dutch_Master	requires specific packages
2016-03-07 12:40:18	reisio	the syntax is: category/package-version
2016-03-07 12:40:29	reisio	don't ask me why every single package.foo file has a different fucking goddamned syntax
2016-03-07 12:40:33	reisio	'cause I don't fuckin' know why :D
2016-03-07 12:40:54	Dutch_Master	that's ok ;-)
2016-03-07 12:41:01	MobileKittuns	KDE / Enlightenment are good alternatives.
2016-03-07 12:41:35	reisio	Dutch_Master: I have a better hack, anyway
2016-03-07 12:42:08	Dutch_Master	here's emerge @world, still wanting mate-notification-daemon: https://bpaste.net/show/2108836d3f7d
2016-03-07 12:42:15	reisio	Dutch_Master: put an empty script named 'notify-send' into /usr/local/bin
2016-03-07 12:42:22	Dutch_Master	don't mind the rest btw
2016-03-07 12:42:26	reisio	Dutch_Master: what've you got in package.provided?
2016-03-07 12:42:35	Dutch_Master	just a sec
2016-03-07 12:43:00	reisio	you'd want this: x11-misc/mate-notification-daemon-1.10.2
2016-03-07 12:43:07	Dutch_Master	https://bpaste.net/show/e2a6aff44e0e
2016-03-07 12:43:38	reisio	combine with >x11-misc/mate-notification-daemon-1.10.2 in package.mask, and portage will even complain at you if you need to take action in the future
2016-03-07 12:43:55	Dutch_Master	will try
2016-03-07 12:44:03	reisio	Dutch_Master: notification, not notificationS
2016-03-07 12:44:04	reisio	:D
2016-03-07 12:44:54	Dutch_Master	oh, fsck! bl**dy type :-(
2016-03-07 12:45:08	Dutch_Master	and even that gets a typo :-(
2016-03-07 12:45:36	reisio	yeah I'm typing for shit this year
2016-03-07 12:47:29	Dutch_Master	well, package.mask was altered, as well as package.provided, but it still wants to install that package
2016-03-07 12:47:41	 > 	spylinux (~spylinux@unaffiliated/spylinux) has joined #funtoo
2016-03-07 12:48:19	Dutch_Master	given that a number of other packages are updated as well, I'll have it run, for now
2016-03-07 12:49:18	reisio	then you've got the syntax wrong still :D
2016-03-07 12:49:23	Dutch_Master	might take a while: git
2016-03-07 12:49:39	Dutch_Master	copied that from you ;-P
2016-03-07 12:50:31	Dutch_Master	package.mask: https://bpaste.net/show/9355aa8941e3
2016-03-07 12:51:02	Dutch_Master	package.provided: https://bpaste.net/show/85418ff6b9d8
2016-03-07 12:51:02	reisio	that's just insurance, though
2016-03-07 12:51:48	reisio	mmm, yeah that should be fine
2016-03-07 12:51:51	reisio	what's your emerge command?
2016-03-07 12:54:10	Dutch_Master	emerge --jobs=4 load-average=2 -auDN @world
2016-03-07 12:54:23	Dutch_Master	emerge --jobs=4 --load-average=2 -auDN @world

2016-03-07 12:54:39	reisio	Dutch_Master: try without -D
2016-03-07 12:54:48	Dutch_Master	ok
2016-03-07 12:54:50	reisio	I forget if that matters
2016-03-07 12:54:55	reisio	obviously it shouldn't, but :p
2016-03-07 12:56:16	Dutch_Master	well, as I've installed the lot, it came back empty
2016-03-07 12:56:43	Dutch_Master	even though I removed mate-noti-etc-daemon
2016-03-07 12:57:01	reisio	dunno what you just said :p
2016-03-07 12:57:14	Dutch_Master	does keep getting libs that won't rebuild though :-(
2016-03-07 12:59:00	Dutch_Master	ah, with the D option emerge wants to reinstall mate-noti-stuff
2016-03-07 13:00:48	reisio	Dutch_Master: try this: touch /usr/local/bin/notify-send; chmod +x /usr/local/bin/notify-send
2016-03-07 13:02:05	Dutch_Master	ok
2016-03-07 13:02:52	reisio	should be able to use that entirely instead of package.provided/package.mask
2016-03-07 13:03:40	Dutch_Master	right, I'll remove package.provided then
2016-03-07 13:04:05	reisio	path hacks ftw
2016-03-07 13:04:29	Dutch_Master	yeah, I realise that
2016-03-07 13:08:12	Dutch_Master	well, stae of play ATM: I've removed mate-notification-daemon, have the package marked in package.mask and emerge *still* wants to emerge it :-(
2016-03-07 13:08:22	Dutch_Master	+t somewhere
2016-03-07 13:09:09	reisio	you don't need it in package.provided or package.mask if you're going to use the /usr/local/bin/ hack
2016-03-07 13:09:22	reisio	every call to notify-send will point at an empty file, and execute nothing at all
2016-03-07 13:09:37	Dutch_Master	oh, right. I did remove package.provided already
2016-03-07 13:10:06	Dutch_Master	so, reinstall the lot, do the path hack again and I should be fine?
2016-03-07 13:11:17	reisio	path hack alone should do it
2016-03-07 13:11:24	reisio	you can have mate-notification-daemon installed if you want
2016-03-07 13:11:42	reisio	which I s'pose I would do, as x11-misc/notification-daemon has more GNOME deps, and they'll be GNOME 3 deps
2016-03-07 13:13:56	Dutch_Master	yeah, well, that's a bit of a problem: emerge @preserved-rebuild quits while it can't find work, yet emerge states there's tons of rebuild libs
2016-03-07 13:14:31	reisio	some other problem, that is :)

2016-03-08 14:53:03	PaddyMac	how to I save my iptables config? I thought it was "rc-service iptabeables save", but apparently now because I just realized that the iptables config I set up yesterday is gone after a reboot.
2016-03-08 14:53:29	PaddyMac	Except I sleppled it correctly when i did it.

2016-03-08 15:00:04	PaddyMac	OK. Now I'm really confused. I ran "/etc/init.d/iptables start" and it started and "iptables -S" showed my saved rules from yesterday. But "rc-update" shows that iptables and ip6tables are indeed added to default, so shouldn't they have been started with my saved rules loaded?
2016-03-08 15:00:41	PaddyMac	Whereas before, "iptables -S" showed only the default config (allow everything).

2016-03-08 15:36:26	PaddyMac	It looks like my config was indeed saved. But any idea why my config wasn't loaded (and iptables apparently not even started) even though I have it added to the default runlevel?
2016-03-08 15:38:11	PaddyMac	Well, I don't reboot very often -- mostly just when I upgrade the kernel. So maybe it won't be too big of an issue until I figure out what's going on.
2016-03-08 15:38:58	PaddyMac	I'm installing Funtoo on a secondhand machine I got today. It'll be interesting to see if the 256 MB RAM is going to be a problem.

2016-03-08 15:41:34	PaddyMac	Interesting. I may look into that if I really have to run on a memory-constrained system. But I plan to upgrade this box to 2 GB. PC 2700 RAM is cheap these days.
2016-03-08 15:42:06	PaddyMac	It's destined to be a dedicated web proxy server.

2016-03-08 17:26:57	PaddyMac	Are there any performance benefits to a minimalistic libc? That would be the primary reason I would consider it on a desktop/server. Though I might consider the smaller memory footprint if it was significant enough.

2016-03-08 17:28:59	PaddyMac	And so far the install is going okay. It's just a little slow due to small memory.

2016-03-08 18:53:48	PaddyMac	I've finished installing Funtoo on that secondhand computer I have. I booted it from a system rescue cd and then ssh'd into it from my primary desktop to administer the installation. It's connected via wireless. What's the best way to get it to connect automatically to the wireless network automatically after it reboots? I'd rather not go the network manager route.
2016-03-08 18:58:16	hcit	I configured mine to start this script at login (window manager autostart functionality): https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6b708a88f8338b812b3d
2016-03-08 18:59:48	PaddyMac	I don't even plan to install any gui on this box. That's teh main reason for not wanting to go the networkmanager route.
2016-03-08 19:00:17	kahiru	PaddyMac: I think you could set up wpa_supplicant and start it as openrc service

2016-03-08 19:12:30	 > 	gwash (~gwash@156.201.73.254) has joined #funtoo
2016-03-08 19:16:00	PaddyMac	Temporary necessity. I had a spare wireless dongle but I couldn't find an extra networking cable.
2016-03-08 19:16:21	PaddyMac	Eventually I'll just use dhcpcd and plug it directly into the router.
2016-03-08 19:17:54	PaddyMac	I also noticed something strange. I did an ip scan of my network, and it shows a kindle on my network. I don't even own a kindle. The ping is 211 ms whereas all my devices are around 15 ms.
2016-03-08 19:18:44	PaddyMac	I can ping the device and get an imcp response. I'm wondering if a neighbor has somehow hacked into my wireless.
2016-03-08 19:18:54	PaddyMac	I'm using WPA
2016-03-08 19:18:57	hcit	how do you know it's a kindle?
2016-03-08 19:19:07	PaddyMac	because of the hostname
2016-03-08 19:19:51	kahiru	nmap can figure out manufacturer of the network hardware from the mac address if i recall
2016-03-08 19:20:08	PaddyMac	Any idea what command I would need to use?
2016-03-08 19:20:15	kahiru	just a moment
2016-03-08 19:21:27	PaddyMac	nmap shows an http service on port 8008
2016-03-08 19:23:52	PaddyMac	I do have an Amazon Fire TV stick. I wonder if that's it and it just has a hostname of kindle?
2016-03-08 19:25:58	kahiru	try os detection with nmap -A $ip
2016-03-08 19:26:31	hcit	or pull it out and try to ping it
2016-03-08 19:27:43	kahiru	^ yeah... but that's no fun
2016-03-08 19:27:53	hcit	true!
2016-03-08 19:28:10	PaddyMac	Service Info: Device: media device
2016-03-08 19:29:25	PaddyMac	It probably is the Fire TV stick. I just didn't expect it to be active. I figured it went to sleep when not in use for a while. Like the Roku turns off and doesn't show up on my network at all.
2016-03-08 19:29:40	PaddyMac	But it sure does have a high ping.
2016-03-08 19:31:43	PaddyMac	Apparently port 8008 is used for media streaming/Chromecast functionality or some such.
2016-03-08 19:32:19	kahiru	interesting
2016-03-08 19:33:03	PaddyMac	But I'm too tired to think about it too deeply. It's 2:30 AM. My mind was too active to sleep, so I got up. I'm waiting for my melatonin and chamomile to kick in.
2016-03-08 19:33:31	PaddyMac	So hopefully I'm not exhausted for my monthly meeting for work tomorrow.
2016-03-08 19:33:43	kahiru	something important?
2016-03-08 19:35:11	PaddyMac	Not really. We have a monthly meeting for lunch at Red Lobster and listen to an ongoing education presentation on some topic. I work in pest control, so the presentations are on some topic of interest for pest control professionals.
2016-03-08 19:35:31	PaddyMac	At least for me, it is a free lucnh.
2016-03-08 19:36:22	PaddyMac	And my morning is clear, so at least I don't have any early appointments. An 8:00 AM appointment after a night of insomnia is no fun.
2016-03-08 19:37:58	kahiru	sounds godd
2016-03-08 19:38:08	kahiru	expcept for the night part
2016-03-08 19:38:22	PaddyMac	It is. I actually enjoy my job.
2016-03-08 19:38:52	PaddyMac	It's far better than the desk job I had for nearly 4 years in a call center.

2016-03-08 19:47:20	PaddyMac	Well, if I want a good night's rest without my mind suddenly becoming alert, just as I'm drifting off to sleep, with fears and worries about past bad decisions and their eventual consequences if I don't make some changes.
2016-03-08 19:47:38	PaddyMac	I guess everyone has those thoughts from time to time.
2016-03-08 19:48:33	PaddyMac	At least the popularity of memes joking about such things on Facebook would certainly seem to indicate that. :-)
2016-03-08 19:49:49	kahiru	yeah, it happens
2016-03-08 19:53:05	PaddyMac	Well, I think I'm going to try hitting the sack again shortly. My melatonin and chamomile tea are kicking in. Too bad I don't have any valerian root. That would be a nice addition.

2016-03-08 19:55:57	PaddyMac	I didn't know common motherwort had those effects. I know Siberian motherwort has some calming effects; it's sometimes sold as a "legal high" for smoking.
2016-03-08 19:56:20	PaddyMac	But it's good for anxiety, eh?

2016-03-09 09:03:30	Mengele	I did fdisk and my boot partition 256M. I mount it and do a df -h and it shows my parititon is only 1002K
2016-03-09 09:03:33	Mengele	da hell
2016-03-09 09:03:50	Mengele	I go back to verify sda1 and it says 256M still
2016-03-09 09:03:56	*	Mengele scratches head.
2016-03-09 09:07:12	Mengele	I reformatted now its saying theres 248M in the partition. Something is screwy here
2016-03-09 09:10:21	Dutch_Master	@Mengele: boot sysrescuecde in graphical mode and use gfdisk instead.
2016-03-09 09:10:31	Mengele	Dutch_Master I am
2016-03-09 09:10:41	Mengele	Just doing everything command line

2016-03-09 09:35:44	fs0ciety	in other words, lots of sawtooth synths.  yeah its a hardware synth and vst
2016-03-09 09:35:52	fs0ciety	i used to write a lot of electronic music :)
2016-03-09 09:36:02	Mengele	I like it.
2016-03-09 09:36:11	Mengele	I liked trap and dubstep before people kenw what it was.

2016-03-09 09:36:25	fs0ciety	i more intro breakcore and jungle :)
2016-03-09 09:36:28	fs0ciety	into*
2016-03-09 09:36:48	Mengele	If I could find somebody that did horror music in a trap-ish form I would love it
2016-03-09 09:37:05	fs0ciety	breakcore = venetian snare, some squarepusher, drumcorps
2016-03-09 09:37:10	fs0ciety	Mengele: it probably exists :)
2016-03-09 09:37:46	*	Dutch_Master is oldskool
2016-03-09 09:38:37	Mengele	Probably does fs0ciety. Again though, I have yet to hear a good banging song like this in a while (for a lack of better terms). Yes it only came out in mid December but I remember running into tracks like this on a daily occasion.
2016-03-09 09:39:33	fs0ciety	Personally I more into progressive rock and metal myself.  That comes from being a drummer. Hahaha
2016-03-09 09:39:54	Mengele	I was a drummer for about ten years.

2016-03-09 09:40:30	Mengele	I actually was starting to do trap beats with my electronic drumset but people told me I was crazy and whatnot. I gave it up about a year and a half later

2016-03-09 09:48:41	Mengele	I fubared something already lol
2016-03-09 09:48:45	Mengele	My make.conf is empty
2016-03-09 09:49:16	fs0ciety	Mengele: Haha.. nice.. I've just been trying to emulate the faster breakcore stuff on the kit for a while. Jojo Mayer is the best man to watch for analysis on that
2016-03-09 09:49:22	Uniaika	fs0ciety: call me "madam"
2016-03-09 09:49:33	fs0ciety	Uniaika: Nice madam :P

2016-03-09 09:49:50	Uniaika	:P
2016-03-09 09:49:53	Mengele	Its not supposed to be empty, is it?
2016-03-09 09:49:57	fs0ciety	Uniaika: Squarepusher was in Australia recently, unfortunately I missed his performance
2016-03-09 09:50:28	Dutch_Master	@Megele: a clean install, make.conf is most definitely empty, yes :-)
2016-03-09 09:51:01	Mengele	Dutch_Master Must be different than Gentoo? Isnt there normally thinks like CFLAGS="" and LDFLAGS=""
2016-03-09 09:51:02	Mengele	etc
2016-03-09 09:51:30	Mengele	CHOST
2016-03-09 09:51:39	Mengele	or in Funtoo is it set somewhere else?
2016-03-09 09:51:50	kahiru_	arent the CFLAGS and friends taken from the hardware profiles?
2016-03-09 09:52:47	Mengele	I am coming from Gentoo so its possible I am doing things just fine

2016-03-09 09:55:48	Dutch_Master	Funtoo is a little different from Gentoo
2016-03-09 09:56:11	Dutch_Master	not overly so, but you'll notice the differences
2016-03-09 09:56:19	Mengele	Yeah I understand that. I dont see a F vs G though
2016-03-09 09:56:34	*	Dutch_Master never got a working Gentoo though
2016-03-09 09:56:37	Mengele	Its alright. I am just tired and trying to pound this out.
2016-03-09 09:56:44	Mengele	What? Lol. Why not Dutch_Master ?
2016-03-09 09:56:58	Dutch_Master	I came from Debian last year
2016-03-09 09:57:09	Mengele	ah 10 4
2016-03-09 09:57:29	Dutch_Master	spomehow the instructions didn't work for me, the Funtoo one ws much better
2016-03-09 09:58:03	Mengele	I love Gentoo and have been with them for 8 ish years. I got pissed off not too long ago at the mods and got banned and pretty much told them to go fuck themselves.
2016-03-09 09:59:05	Dutch_Master	not smart
2016-03-09 09:59:23	Dutch_Master	there's a lot of interaction between Funtoo and Gentoo devs
2016-03-09 09:59:40	Mengele	I got banned for a dumb reason and already taxed all the I am sorrys to get out of it
2016-03-09 10:00:02	Mengele	Im going to stay out of the -dev chanel
2016-03-09 10:00:20	Dutch_Master	good call ;-)
2016-03-09 10:00:25	Mengele	just keeping myself away from that croud. One of the old ops is in here, I knew hime for a while... Cant remember his name now though
2016-03-09 10:01:27	*	Dutch_Master has learned to stay out of other people's disputes :-\

2016-03-09 10:02:02	Mengele	Lol. It wasnt a dispute really. GCC was throwing an error because of something with Gentoo and they said it was off topic.
2016-03-09 10:03:44	Mengele	And then another mod got into it and was trying to help me out. Got kicked about an hour later because somebody complained. Kronic I am pretty sure - a 30 year old still in his parents basement wearing depends.
2016-03-09 10:03:51	Mengele	Anyway
2016-03-09 10:04:22	Uniaika	basement dwellers… >_>
2016-03-09 10:05:01	Mengele	I actually had my highschool reunion in November - 10 years. Theres a kid there that is still living in his parents basement.
2016-03-09 10:05:51	*	Dutch_Master has left skool a lot longer then that :-P

2016-03-09 10:07:09	Mengele	Alright I am confused here. Funtoo wants to use Debian Sources, whatever I say BUT if I want to build a different one whats all this binary talk..
2016-03-09 10:07:30	Dutch_Master	you can
2016-03-09 10:07:30	Mengele	?
2016-03-09 10:07:39	fs0ciety	i use gentoo sources over debian sources
2016-03-09 10:07:42	Dutch_Master	but takes a lot longer!
2016-03-09 10:08:08	Mengele	I need to patch my kernel unless Debian Sources has reiser4 support...
2016-03-09 10:08:24	Dutch_Master	I'd suggest to get Funtoo running wioth the Debian kernel, then compile your own later
2016-03-09 10:08:46	Dutch_Master	dunno, Reiser4 is pretty broken
2016-03-09 10:08:55	Mengele	Reiser4 is not broken
2016-03-09 10:08:59	Mengele	<3
2016-03-09 10:09:53	fs0ciety	I use kergen to get a basis kernel and go from there, actually to be honest I install the majority of the system in chroot and then reset into it. 
2016-03-09 10:11:18	*	Dutch_Master has build quite a few kernels, 2.6 onwards, for nVidia support
2016-03-09 10:11:39	Dutch_Master	even wrote a quick script ;-P
2016-03-09 10:12:52	fs0ciety	nice.. yeah i've been writing a funtoo maintanence application using blessed and nodejs for my own amusement. I've called it skynet.. haha.
2016-03-09 10:12:59	fs0ciety	still have to complete it though
2016-03-09 10:13:50	fs0ciety	Mengele: did the basement dweller have awkward social skills?
2016-03-09 10:14:01	Dutch_Master	:-)
2016-03-09 10:14:07	Mengele	fs0ciety just a douche bag.
2016-03-09 10:14:09	fs0ciety	Mengele: did he asked to roll a 20 sided die to make decisions about life
2016-03-09 10:14:14	fs0ciety	ask*
2016-03-09 10:14:19	Mengele	Ha
2016-03-09 10:14:23	Mengele	Probably
2016-03-09 10:14:39	Dutch_Master	here it is, not quite up-to-date though ;-P

2016-03-09 10:15:35	Mengele	How did it go?
2016-03-09 10:16:17	fs0ciety	Dutch_Master: simple - yet effective :)

2016-03-09 10:20:23	Mengele	Great  I need to patch the sources
2016-03-09 10:20:26	Mengele	sooo lets see here
2016-03-09 10:20:49	Mengele	How do I do that with Funtoo? I think seeing as there are binarys and headers that there is no real kernel?

2016-03-09 11:19:18	Mengele	Didnt mean it like that. I just thought mrproper was when you were really digging deep into the kernel code
2016-03-09 11:20:21	sandro_	Using genkernel, you can see in stdout that it runs "make mrproper"

2016-03-09 11:24:25	Mengele	Fuck. Make mrproper nukes everything
2016-03-09 11:24:43	Mengele	I knew I shouldnt have done that lol
2016-03-09 11:27:23	sandro_	Now i'm downloading the 4.4.4 (with enabled "experimental" use flag)
2016-03-09 11:28:39	sandro_	Mengele: but, to make an experiment i must have your kernel-config.
2016-03-09 11:29:03	Mengele	I have to rebuild it. I listened to somebody I shouldnt have and nuked my config =P
2016-03-09 11:29:39	sandro_	then ... with "basis" .config ?
2016-03-09 11:29:50	Mengele	The config I had ready to go
2016-03-09 11:29:54	Mengele	I should have mv it

2016-03-09 11:32:05	sandro_	and start with make -j9 ?
2016-03-09 11:32:11	Mengele	You shouldnt have to but if I get the error again who knows
2016-03-09 11:33:06	sandro_	I can make a test using your configuration ....

2016-03-09 11:36:11	+_`_	Dutch_Master: I haven't used cross-dev. But it sounds like filing a br wouldn't be a bad idea from what you say the error is.

2016-03-09 11:40:26	sandro_	more "monolithic" than "modular"
2016-03-09 11:40:34	Mengele	So...?

2016-03-09 11:42:35	sandro_	excuse me ... once selected the kernel version, cd /usr/src/linux

2016-03-09 11:46:07	Mengele	not with gentoo-sources

2016-03-09 11:51:42	Mengele	radeon
2016-03-09 11:52:27	sandro_	if is a new radeon we can use the "proprietary drivers (fglrx)" or the Open source drivers "radeon".
2016-03-09 11:53:26	sandro_	example, in /etc/portage/make.conf
2016-03-09 11:53:57	sandro_	VIDEO_CARDS="radeon" (will use radeon open source drivers)
2016-03-09 11:53:58	sandro_	or
2016-03-09 11:54:30	sandro_	VIDEO_CARDS="fglrx" (will use the proprietary AMD drivers)
2016-03-09 11:55:44	sandro_	But if you want to use the fglrx, you must disable in kernel -> device-drivers , the radeon drivers (for not create "conflict").

2016-03-09 13:58:03	ed-209	so, instead of 'bzImage', I'd use 'vmlinux-[v]' or whatever it is

2016-03-10 04:54:54	vifino	Oh well.
2016-03-10 04:55:06	vifino	Anyhow, I have a huge amount of trouble with kernels.
2016-03-10 04:55:16	komunista	vifino: and I have the nvidia in modules varible in /etc/conf.d/modules file
2016-03-10 04:55:43	vifino	If I try to grab some kernel (like gentoo-sources), they can't find the rootfs.

2016-03-10 05:13:28	coffnix	i need rebuild this dir
2016-03-10 05:13:33	Mengele	coffnix oh fun, which fs?
2016-03-10 05:13:38	coffnix	ext4 with SSD :(
2016-03-10 05:13:49	Mengele	Thats why I never use ext3
2016-03-10 05:13:52	Mengele	ext4

2016-03-10 05:14:23	coffnix	this script not work fine http://dev.gentoo.org/~dberkholz/scripts/regenpkgdb
2016-03-10 05:15:01	Mengele	I get told I am crazy all the time but I have used reiserfs and reiser4 for years. Ive lost more data with ext4 and ext3 (before ext4 was out) than my years with reiser* in a raid0 WITH notail and noatime enabled
2016-03-10 05:17:05	Mengele	Reiser4, when tuned correctly, outperforms ext4 any day of the week in real world scenarios. Now back up here, I have lost data with reiser* but that was because I was extremely drunk one night and something wasnt installing right and I decided to literally kick the side of my machine. I ended up having to replace all of my drives and a fan or two lol.
2016-03-10 05:17:11	coffnix	agree
2016-03-10 05:17:13	coffnix	reiser > ext
2016-03-10 05:19:15	Mengele	Then why are you using ext coffnix ? lol
2016-03-10 05:19:40	Mengele	I dont think reiser likes ssd's but theres better out there. F2fs or something like that I believe...
2016-03-10 05:21:14	coffnix	aahuahahuahuahua
2016-03-10 05:21:24	coffnix	i never lost data with ext4 :(
2016-03-10 05:21:47	Mengele	Woh. Talk about old school. I am shocked funtoo is stuck in 1998 with gcc 4.9
2016-03-10 05:21:48	coffnix	there is always a first time
2016-03-10 05:21:58	Mengele	And last coffnix =)

2016-03-10 05:22:43	coffnix	rebuilding*

2016-03-10 05:56:59	Mengele	I have no good reason to want to upgrade gcc, maybe better ricer commands and options but besides that, no good reasons again.

2016-03-10 06:04:25	Mengele	Im not defending him, the reason why I chose this name is because a lot of people have no idea who he is.

2016-03-10 06:05:10	Mengele	But yeah, not really trying to troll either.Anyway what happened to hparker ed-209 ?

2016-03-10 14:44:02	Hell-Razor	This has been one of the things where I have kept quiet as long as I can and I really do want to throw my computer out the window.
2016-03-10 14:44:25	reisio	what's up?
2016-03-10 14:46:53	Hell-Razor	I am trying to install ati-drivers. They are pretty old in the funtoo repository but that is another issue for later (That being - #ati only helps those with up to date drivers). I am emerging and get this error.. http://nopaste.linux-dev.org/?990351

2016-03-10 14:51:41	Hell-Razor	reisio I tried that. Lead me on a whole nother goose hunt
2016-03-10 14:51:53	Hell-Razor	I will try installing it through layman this time and see how things go
2016-03-10 14:52:53	reisio	why through layman
2016-03-10 14:53:10	chry	Or you could just use an ebuild as a reference for your own ebuild with the newest driver...
2016-03-10 14:53:34	Hell-Razor	chry I tried that. It complained about patches and scripts being fubar.
2016-03-10 14:54:13	Hell-Razor	reisio Because its the only way I know how at this point?
2016-03-10 14:54:17	reisio	well, something wrong with radeon?
2016-03-10 14:54:23	reisio	Hell-Razor: 15 is in funtoo's tree
2016-03-10 14:54:39	chry	Err...I'll try and mix something up when I get home...might be useful for me as well... ;p
2016-03-10 14:54:41	Hell-Razor	reisio it is?
2016-03-10 14:55:10	chry	But, as reisio said, radeon drivers are perfectly fine...even better than fglrx for older cards...
2016-03-10 14:55:23	Hell-Razor	I have a pretty new card
2016-03-10 14:56:17	reisio	Hell-Razor: yes it is

2016-03-10 14:57:46	chry	That is quite new...
2016-03-10 14:57:54	Hell-Razor	 Latest version available: 14.12-r4 reisio
2016-03-10 14:58:03	Hell-Razor	got it for $100 off craigs list lol. Probably stolen chry
2016-03-10 14:58:07	reisio	Hell-Razor: you got eix?
2016-03-10 14:58:23	Hell-Razor	reisio I do now.
2016-03-10 14:58:45	reisio	eix is usually my first stop: eix -e ati-drivers
2016-03-10 14:58:53	reisio	that'll tell you what's available, fast, with good info
2016-03-10 14:59:18	Hell-Razor	Dont you have to constantly update it?
2016-03-10 14:59:54	reisio	eix?
2016-03-10 14:59:58	reisio	not more frequently than you sync
2016-03-10 15:00:04	reisio	emerge --sync; eix-update
2016-03-10 15:00:06	chry	Hell-Razor, well, as long as it works... ;3
2016-03-10 15:00:07	reisio	or you can use eix-sync if you want
2016-03-10 15:00:10	*	reisio doesn't, personally
2016-03-10 15:00:16	chry	eix-sync ftw
2016-03-10 15:00:19	chry	;d
2016-03-10 15:00:26	Hell-Razor	I havent been able to sync in a day or two. Says I am up to date but I dont think thats true
2016-03-10 15:00:28	reisio	chry: does it spit out new things in the tree?
2016-03-10 15:00:43	reisio	Hell-Razor: another problem :p
2016-03-10 15:00:50	chry	Ehm...I haven't noticed so far....
2016-03-10 15:00:55	Hell-Razor	reisio just wait I will find more problems.
2016-03-10 15:01:22	reisio	chry: vaguely recall that being a feature
2016-03-10 15:01:26	reisio	like, a reason to use eix-sync
2016-03-10 15:03:12	Hell-Razor	Awesome. Three hours of debugging and five minutes to fix it by asking for help on here... Great lol.
2016-03-10 15:03:13	shamus397	yes, and it points out removals too
2016-03-10 15:03:30	chry	I guess it adds new stuff when overlays are used...but a) I don't use them and b) even if I do use them, I always mask them
2016-03-10 15:04:11	shamus397	eix is awesome and anyone who doesn't think so is wrong ;-)
2016-03-10 15:04:39	chry	Agreed...
2016-03-10 15:04:56	Hell-Razor	Haha. Ive never used eix. Does it have an install option too?
2016-03-10 15:05:09	Hell-Razor	(My machine is now rebooting or else I would look).
2016-03-10 15:06:15	chry	I use it mainly for syncing... ;p
2016-03-10 15:06:29	reisio	power of irc
2016-03-10 15:06:33	chry	But it does have a lot of useful features...

2016-03-11 01:48:44	spylinux	The install occour fine, but i'm trying to use kernel vanilla with Slackware config, but after install kernel and compile it with config, and enter in /boot/ folder to create a symbolic link from kernel-4.x to bzImage, i cant
2016-03-11 01:49:01	spylinux	Error, you can't create this link

2016-03-11 09:01:37	sandro_	Hi timofonic
2016-03-11 09:01:51	timofonic	Are there some easy to setup service to rent a build machine' VM or whatever. I would like to build Funtoo and my experiments faster, not sure ir WAN can be a bottleneck
2016-03-11 09:02:04	timofonic	I mean a build machine for Funtoo
2016-03-11 09:02:58	timofonic	"build these packages for this and this with this profile and /etc/portage/*, then this other, then this Beaglebone Black...
2016-03-11 09:05:00	sandro_	(imho) no VM but a partition or external usb hdd (for example)
2016-03-11 09:05:28	sandro_	so you can "taste" the real performances of Funtoo.
2016-03-11 09:05:35	timofonic	sandro_: I mean rent a hardware running somewhere
2016-03-11 09:05:42	timofonic	to build my stuff
2016-03-11 09:05:53	sandro_	Ah ok ... excuse me :)

2016-03-11 14:17:22	berenger	i have to comment hem. update portage. uncomment hem et after it's going ok for mme

2016-03-11 14:18:09	berenger	check also if you not specifie in your package.use

2016-03-11 14:18:41	berenger	that update gone me crazy
2016-03-11 14:18:57	Shinigami-Sama	I found some stuff in the forums: merge all the pythons in manually with -a and it looks like its going
2016-03-11 14:19:20	Shinigami-Sama	someone else mentioned pythontargets as well but I couldn't find anything in my config for it
2016-03-11 14:19:23	Shinigami-Sama	oh shit, there it goes

2016-03-11 14:19:50	PaddyMac	pastebin your error output. That might help.
2016-03-11 14:21:01	PaddyMac	It seems like I helped someone deal with a similar error a few weeks ago. They were trying to emerge a masked package without unmasking the dependencies.
2016-03-11 14:21:43	Shinigami-Sama	yeah, 3.5 was claiming it was masked earlier as well
2016-03-11 14:21:54	Shinigami-Sama	but I didn't notice it in the dep tree so I ignored it
2016-03-11 14:21:59	PaddyMac	Often, you can get around conflicts by unmerging a conflicting package entirely before updating.
2016-03-11 14:22:39	PaddyMac	...which is usually fine unless it's a critical dep like glibc or gcc
2016-03-11 14:23:15	PaddyMac	or bash or ncurses. Good lord never unmerge ncurses!
2016-03-11 14:23:18	Shinigami-Sama	hard to remove python and have a working portage
2016-03-11 14:23:36	Shinigami-Sama	...I can't copy out of kosole now?
2016-03-11 14:23:51	PaddyMac	It shouldn't be an issue as long as the version of python you unmerge is not the same as the version Portage is dependeing on.
2016-03-11 14:24:21	PaddyMac	You can emerge Portage with use flags that make sure it doesn't depend on the version of Pythin you're unmerging.
2016-03-11 14:24:42	chry	What is your python single target? I have 2.7 set as single target and 2.7,3.4 in targets and I never had issues...
2016-03-11 14:24:51	PaddyMac	Now that I think about it, a few weeks ago I had to emerge Portage so it was dependent on the newly unmasked Pythion 3.4 before I could update Pythion.

2016-03-11 14:26:28	PaddyMac	Anyway, if you could share your actual Portage output, it could help. Otherwise, I can only offer speculation.
2016-03-11 14:27:02	Shinigami-Sama	I can't copy/paste from konsole at the monent, let me direct to a file and try that...
2016-03-11 14:27:31	PaddyMac	I had that issue with konsole years ago. Now I don't remember what the cause/fix was.
2016-03-11 14:27:56	PaddyMac	I might have still been with KDE 3 back then.
2016-03-11 14:28:12	berenger	if it's like i got, it's a 10km output about every package depending on python commplaining about python taget and single target
2016-03-11 14:28:21	Shinigami-Sama	I need to refresh my X session, because I had to make some ENV changes to get icons working again
2016-03-11 14:28:28	Shinigami-Sama	yes, thats what i've got
2016-03-11 14:28:59	Shinigami-Sama	this forum post describes exactly what I'm fighting as well: https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7859106.html
2016-03-11 14:29:15	PaddyMac	At least it's not like an old libpng update.
2016-03-11 14:30:03	Shinigami-Sama	and the actual slot conflict message isn't in std_out... of course, why would be
2016-03-11 14:30:43	berenger	maybe try in your package.use to add sys-apps/portage python_targets_python3_4 python_single_target_python3_4 or dependding the version you use
2016-03-11 14:31:34	berenger	and probably add -python_target_python2_7 -python_single_target_python2_7 for each you dont want

2016-03-11 14:34:45	PaddyMac	often if you see a message like "dev-lang/python:3.4 required by (x11-proto/xcb-proto-1.11:0/0::gentoo, installed) "
2016-03-11 14:35:27	PaddyMac	You can manually emerge the package e.g. "emerge -1v x11-proto/xcb-proto" and get it to emerge anyway
2016-03-11 14:35:47	PaddyMac	That can be tedious if you have to do it manually for a lot fo packages.
2016-03-11 14:35:52	PaddyMac	But it works
2016-03-11 14:36:35	Shinigami-Sama	yeah, I was hoping to avoid thatm uch manual intervension
2016-03-11 14:36:58	PaddyMac	There's probably an easier way....
2016-03-11 14:37:37	PaddyMac	But I'm used to the colorized output of Portage. I often miss teh obvious when I'm looking at monochrome output.
2016-03-11 14:40:40	Shinigami-Sama	I miss being able to copy out of konsole :(
2016-03-11 14:40:56	Shinigami-Sama	ok I think I got it

2016-03-11 18:21:54	Hund	That's what I said. :)
2016-03-11 18:22:27	Hund	But with zsh I just used to run "keychain <key>".

2016-03-11 18:22:58	Hund	And it worked just fine.

2016-03-12 17:56:30	therickaman	So, when I start my computer I get an annoying message: nm-dispatcher 'up', or something like this.  How can I get rid of this during boot?  I'd like to boot and be able to log in, without having to hit enter to bring up a new login
2016-03-12 17:59:01	chry	Do you use eth or wifi?

2016-03-12 18:03:45	therickaman	I use wifi, sorry
2016-03-12 18:04:02	therickaman	I was reading online, trying to find some help.  I can't figure this one out
2016-03-12 18:04:37	chry	And I'm guessing you're using KDE as your DE of choice?
2016-03-12 18:05:46	therickaman	no, I'm not using any DE
2016-03-12 18:06:07	therickaman	and, I'm not using any login manager
2016-03-12 18:06:23	therickaman	I'd like to just boot to a login
2016-03-12 18:06:46	therickaman	I'm able to login, then type startx.  I don't always need a desktop.
2016-03-12 18:07:08	chry	Well, I dunno...if that's the case you could try using wpa_supplicant instead of network manager...
2016-03-12 18:11:27	therickaman	I'm not sure, It's really a minor thing...just annoying to me
2016-03-12 18:12:10	michaelrose	even with network manager you shouldn't have to hit anything to continue to boot
2016-03-12 18:12:55	chry	Well he doesn't have to hit anything, but the messages keep popping up... :D
2016-03-12 18:13:13	@angry_vincent	what message?
2016-03-12 18:13:31	chry	nm-dispatcher blah blah
2016-03-12 18:14:04	michaelrose	he said "I'd like to boot and be able to log in, without having to hit enter to bring up a new login"
2016-03-12 18:14:05	@angry_vincent	does the message looks like nm-dispatcher blah blah?
2016-03-12 18:14:18	chry	It looks like: nm-dispatcher up
2016-03-12 18:14:26	chry	Or something...
2016-03-12 18:14:42	chry	I had the same issue when I was on kde with network manager...
2016-03-12 18:14:46	@angry_vincent	does the message looks like nm-dispatcher up?
2016-03-12 18:15:09	@angry_vincent	key is
2016-03-12 18:15:15	@angry_vincent	how exactly message looks like
2016-03-12 18:15:33	@angry_vincent	then t's possible to look for a problem and what causing it
2016-03-12 18:16:32	chry	therickaman, could you post the exact output, please?
2016-03-12 18:16:39	therickaman	It looks like nm-dispatcher 'up'
2016-03-12 18:16:39	therickaman	it looks like nm-dispatcher 'up'
2016-03-12 18:16:58	therickaman	oops, I think I got knocked off...
2016-03-12 18:17:06	michaelrose	or not
2016-03-12 18:17:18	therickaman	can someone say something so that I know I'm still in the room?
2016-03-12 18:17:24	michaelrose	something

2016-03-12 18:17:32	chry	;p
2016-03-12 18:17:34	therickaman	lol
2016-03-12 18:18:25	therickaman	it looks like, nm-dispatpatcher[] dispatching action 'up' for wlan.0, I think that's the exact message
2016-03-12 18:19:08	chry	It is...
2016-03-12 18:19:10	michaelrose	does it get stuck there for a while?
2016-03-12 18:19:12	therickaman	chry: I'm not sure how to look it up
2016-03-12 18:19:29	therickaman	michaelrose: yes, it seems like 10 seconds isn't enough to connect to the network
2016-03-12 18:19:45	@angry_vincent	therickaman: look in dmesg
2016-03-12 18:20:10	chry	dmesg | grep nm-dispatcher
2016-03-12 18:21:24	therickaman	dmesg | grep nm-dispatcher, gives nothing
2016-03-12 18:21:36	therickaman	this isn't a kernel message
2016-03-12 18:21:46	chry	It's a rc message...
2016-03-12 18:21:53	chry	Do you have a rc log enabled?
2016-03-12 18:22:10	therickaman	I'm not sure, probably not honestly
2016-03-12 18:22:29	michaelrose	looking for discussions online regarding nm-dispatcher shows multiple issues over the years
2016-03-12 18:23:15	therickaman	in fact, how do I enable rc log?
2016-03-12 18:23:42	chry	/etc/rc.conf
2016-03-12 18:23:52	chry	Uncomment rc_logger="yes"
2016-03-12 18:24:07	chry	Here's an example of a similar message: nm-dispatcher[2194]: Dispatching action 'dhcp4-change' for wlan0
2016-03-12 18:24:53	therickaman	yep, that's similar

2016-03-12 18:26:52	michaelrose	other people complaining of the issue said a lot of the extra time was waiting for NetworkManager-wait-online, suggested fix was actually editing the systemd service file to change its time out value doesn't seem applicable

2016-03-12 18:44:50	chry	Yeah...rc log stops at login, but a message appears like 1 second after login shell is invoked...
2016-03-12 18:48:26	chry	The funny thing is...that message isn't technically a problem...it's basically just a nm daemon showing when nm interface is up and also announcing DNS changes...which is why I suspect consolekit being behind all that...

2016-03-12 19:55:25	therickaman	I just wanted to give an update
2016-03-12 19:55:31	therickaman	I finally got what I wished
2016-03-12 19:55:55	therickaman	A computer that when fully booted, displays a login
2016-03-12 19:57:04	therickaman	the way I did it was edit /etc/conf.d/NetworkManager, and set INACTIVE_TIMEOUT to say, 15
2016-03-12 19:57:18	therickaman	this allows enough time for wifi to connect
2016-03-12 19:58:03	therickaman	then, to clear the screen after booting, remove --noclear within /etc/inittab
2016-03-12 20:01:55	therickaman	thanks for all your help!

2016-03-13 00:50:42	Juippis	it needs more testing
2016-03-13 00:50:45	vifino	Or any 5.X version, for that matter.

2016-03-13 01:20:11	therickaman	PaddyMac: Create a script in the /etc/init.d folder.  Since you need to ensure the network is up, make sure you have a depend function that reflects that.  Use chmod +x to make the file executable.  Once this is done, use rc-update add *scriptname* default.
2016-03-13 01:20:48	therickaman	PaddyMac: Take a look at some of the scripts in /etc/init.d that are run at boot time

2016-03-13 01:28:10	shamus397	Juippis: what's wrong is that it's not shiny enough :-P
2016-03-13 01:28:54	therickaman	vifino: If you desire gcc 5 and up, I suggest installing it locally.  It's not very hard to do.  I wouldn't install it to be used globally though, as apparently it can break some builds.

2016-03-13 04:38:00	lautriv_	can anyone tell me something about this -> http://pastebin.ca/3399000 <- problem regarding portage ?
2016-03-13 04:40:44	@angry_vincent	nothing in this output
2016-03-13 04:44:02	lautriv_	just found there is no arm-32bit below /usr/portage/profiles/funtoo/1.0/linux-gnu/arch/  o.O
2016-03-13 04:45:32	@angry_vincent	does not look so

2016-03-13 04:47:05	+_`_	bad sync?
2016-03-13 04:47:52	lautriv_	_`_, _should, since i have it on other (arm) machines but not thisone .... at least since "emerge --sync"
2016-03-13 04:50:47	+_`_	I'd say to check the repository status with git(1) but probably a waste of time. I'd just remove the tree and resync.

2016-03-13 04:51:44	lautriv_	did so, no change. telling me about a new portage fails on "emerge --oneshot portage" because the same parsing errors :(
2016-03-13 04:52:10	@angry_vincent	your portage tree copy is broken
2016-03-13 04:52:16	@angry_vincent	due to various reasons

2016-03-13 04:52:52	+_`_	did you *remove* the entire tree then --sync a whole *new* tree

2016-03-13 04:54:23	lautriv_	i did, because it was ranting about local changes which did not happen. another --synct told me "already up to date"
2016-03-13 04:54:57	+_`_	no another sync should pull the repository again
2016-03-13 04:55:12	+_`_	if you *removed* the tree, like I stated for the third time now
2016-03-13 04:55:53	+_`_	you can fix this with git(1), but like I said, probably not worth the effort (and you'd of done so already anyways).
2016-03-13 04:56:02	lautriv_	_`_, you are talking literally about "rm -r /usr/portage" no ?
2016-03-13 04:56:07	+_`_	yes.
2016-03-13 04:56:17	lautriv_	did so .... will do again.
2016-03-13 04:56:44	+_`_	well I don't keep the tree there, but assuming you do, yes

2016-03-13 16:56:32	Shinigami-Sama	oh I fixed it already
2016-03-13 16:56:49	Shinigami-Sama	it took some doing, and judicious use of emerge -1 and -O
2016-03-13 16:58:14	@drobbins	gcc-5.3 merged
2016-03-13 16:59:37	@angry_vincent	Shinigami-Sama: i see
2016-03-13 16:59:45	@angry_vincent	Shinigami-Sama: was it dated box?
2016-03-13 17:00:20	Shinigami-Sama	~3 months
2016-03-13 17:00:41	Shinigami-Sama	I found someone who had the same problem on our forums
2016-03-13 17:00:51	Shinigami-Sama	and worked out a solution from there
2016-03-13 17:01:30	Shinigami-Sama	some people here helped out too
2016-03-13 17:04:39	@angry_vincent	ok
2016-03-13 17:05:03	@angry_vincent	there are few ways to avoid such things but it's unlikely going to happen
2016-03-13 17:05:20	@angry_vincent	i.e reconsider blocks
2016-03-13 17:05:43	@angry_vincent	sometimes they are meaningless, if not using stronger word
2016-03-13 17:06:30	@drobbins	angry_vincent: the python update seems bad unless people have the latest 3.3 and 2.7
2016-03-13 17:06:39	@drobbins	trying to update an old container, though
2016-03-13 17:07:53	Shinigami-Sama	oh it was a B block, it turned out to be rather meaningless in the end I was able to force portage to just update anyways
2016-03-13 17:08:05	Shinigami-Sama	mgony just pushed bad deps from the looks of discussion
2016-03-13 17:08:12	Shinigami-Sama	or w/e his name is

2016-03-13 17:09:31	Shinigami-Sama	try and merge eselect-python, manually resolve the collision, then one shot the python slots, they'll fail, then try and merge python-exec, if it fails merge without deps, then it should mostly resolve itself
2016-03-13 17:10:11	Shinigami-Sama	I had to oneshot portage, gentoolkit and setup tools afterwards
2016-03-13 17:10:22	Shinigami-Sama	more annoying than anything
2016-03-13 17:11:34	@angry_vincent	i had clean updates. even for older test environment. i had no clean update, if masks, unmasks or custon python_target uses set.
2016-03-13 17:11:45	@drobbins	no clean updates here
2016-03-13 17:12:07	Shinigami-Sama	it wasn't a mask issue, it was slot conflicts
2016-03-13 17:12:51	Shinigami-Sama	old python 2.7,3.3 and 3.4 slots conflicted with the next bump needed for portage, eselect and python-exec
2016-03-13 17:14:05	Shinigami-Sama	in theory, emerge @world -DuN --with-bdeps=y --bactrace=100 should've solved it according to gentoo forums
2016-03-13 17:17:40	@drobbins	I unmerged some python modules after upgrading to latest 2.7 and 3.3 and now @system is OK
2016-03-13 17:17:44	@drobbins	testing it with gcc-5.3.0
2016-03-13 17:17:59	@drobbins	this was a really old container though.
2016-03-13 17:18:20	Shinigami-Sama	angry_vincent: it was basiclly this issue, but for every installed package slot conflicting http://forums.funtoo.org/topic/871-python-is-blocking-eselect-python/
2016-03-13 17:19:12	Shinigami-Sama	followed by this one: http://forums.funtoo.org/topic/893-file-collision-unable-to-update/
2016-03-13 17:19:15	@angry_vincent	ok, if nothing related python configuration is set in system, then it's due to some python packages not letting updates
2016-03-13 17:20:00	Shinigami-Sama	once I managed to get python updated, I ran python-updater and it came back clean
2016-03-13 17:20:21	@angry_vincent	i don't think python-updater needed nowadays
2016-03-13 17:20:26	@drobbins	this system could have still been on progress overlay
2016-03-13 17:20:28	Shinigami-Sama	doesn't appear to be
2016-03-13 17:20:41	Shinigami-Sama	my system was updated a few weeks after progress
2016-03-13 17:20:45	Shinigami-Sama	at least
2016-03-13 17:20:50	@angry_vincent	yes, progress overlay python packages could spoil updates
2016-03-13 17:20:51	Shinigami-Sama	*at least once
2016-03-13 17:22:52	@angry_vincent	going to update container

2016-03-14 23:32:17	skudo	can't find much information regarding boot-update and it's support in finding other OS
2016-03-14 23:32:49	skudo	does boot-update automatically find other OS installed? or do i have to manually edit boot.conf?
2016-03-14 23:32:56	skudo	then run boot-update
2016-03-14 23:34:25	xeirrr	no it doesn't. you need to write boot.conf yourself

2016-03-15 03:48:14	javaJake	You know what'd be a really interesting experiment?
2016-03-15 03:49:20	javaJake	Create a Funtoo vm named 2016-03-1, wait a week, install Funtoo into a new VM and name it 2016-03-2, install Funtoo into another new VM and name it 2016-03-3, and so on, for each week of the month.
2016-03-15 03:50:05	javaJake	Keep doing that every week. When a VM turns one month old, attempt to upgrade it.

2016-03-15 13:15:32	dami0	hey, i'm want to try funtoo, i've got a few questions, what do you guys recommend for bootloader? i'd like it to be simple, i've never really tried anything but grub
2016-03-15 13:15:38	dami0	dual booting with windows would be nice but not required
2016-03-15 13:19:13	@drobbins	use grub as per the install docs
2016-03-15 13:19:54	Shinigami-Sama	grub is decent enough
2016-03-15 13:21:50	Shinigami-Sama	dual booting brings up funny memories for me
2016-03-15 13:22:48	dami0	uh, ok
2016-03-15 13:22:54	dami0	here i am wanting to try new things :P

2016-03-15 13:25:48	Shinigami-Sama	its just the last time I dual booted was uh....6 years ago?
2016-03-15 13:26:05	Shinigami-Sama	7?
2016-03-15 13:26:29	Shinigami-Sama	different times
2016-03-15 13:26:53	dami0	yeah, to be honest i haven't used windows for anything other than games for about as long
2016-03-15 13:26:58	dami0	and even then it was fairly sporadic
2016-03-15 13:26:58	 < 	kelsoo (~kelsoo@86.53.50.178) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.3)
2016-03-15 13:27:47	dami0	which brings the next questions, do you guys have a -ck patchset kernel i can install fairly nicely and with all the nice patches like the suspend fix?
2016-03-15 13:28:14	dami0	i'm currently running it on arch but i get my fs remounted read only fairly often, tends to break things a lot
2016-03-15 13:29:38	Shinigami-Sama	I use the -pf set
2016-03-15 13:29:43	Shinigami-Sama	works great most of the time
2016-03-15 13:30:12	dami0	don't even know what that is, i'm mostly looking for that sweet sweet os scheduler, keeps things minty fresh and responsive
2016-03-15 13:30:14	Shinigami-Sama	I don't honestly know why I use pf anymore, but I do
2016-03-15 13:30:21	Shinigami-Sama	pf is ck + others
2016-03-15 13:30:26	dami0	ah, nice
2016-03-15 13:30:32	Shinigami-Sama	mostly hiber/suspend stuff
2016-03-15 13:30:46	dami0	yeah, that's where base -ck tends to drop the ball, i'll use pf
2016-03-15 13:30:47	Shinigami-Sama	it had a thing I wanted about 4 years ago, I don't remember what the thing was anymore

2016-03-15 13:31:10	Shinigami-Sama	I think it was bqf maybe?
2016-03-15 13:31:41	Shinigami-Sama	I remember getting some absurd scheduler nonsense for a while there
2016-03-15 13:31:43	dami0	basic fair queuing? brain fuck scheduler? one of those was disk io one was cpu
2016-03-15 13:31:50	 > 	kelsoo (~kelsoo@86.53.50.178) has joined #funtoo
2016-03-15 13:31:55	Shinigami-Sama	one of them, I don't rememember which
2016-03-15 13:32:06	terabit	anyone get a chance to look at my problem yet?
2016-03-15 13:32:26	Shinigami-Sama	oh wait, I remember, to was the CPU scheduler, because CFS was killing my dorf fortress games
2016-03-15 13:32:50	@drobbins	terabit: what problems?
2016-03-15 13:32:52	terabit	a la https://bpaste.net/show/1a661eb000b2
2016-03-15 13:33:05	terabit	world upgrade failing on that
2016-03-15 13:33:53	Shinigami-Sama	does that patch exist?
2016-03-15 13:33:55	terabit	not sure what to try

2016-03-15 13:36:54	terabit	that might help (build output instructs to include that in the bug report)
2016-03-15 13:37:14	@drobbins	terabit: what is your epro show output?
2016-03-15 13:37:50	terabit	drobbins: https://bpaste.net/show/44fd4bc0df3b
2016-03-15 13:38:15	@drobbins	terabit: so this is a hardened-specific bug. Did you unmask this gcc?
2016-03-15 13:39:08	terabit	it is a hardened install, I didn't unmask anything. this install hasn't been updated in 1-2months (didn't have internet) , just did emerge --sync and emerge -uDNav @world
2016-03-15 13:39:23	terabit	at least I didn't unmask anything to day
2016-03-15 13:39:51	terabit	hmm

2016-03-15 13:40:29	terabit	I'll remove that line and retry , thanks !
2016-03-15 13:40:45	@drobbins	terabit: try unmasking gcc-4.9.3-r2 and see if that fixes it
2016-03-15 13:40:55	@drobbins	terabit: we have an open bug report for this but need testing.

2016-03-15 13:47:04	dami0	http://build.funtoo.org/distfiles/sysresccd/systemrescuecd-x86-4.5.0.iso
2016-03-15 13:47:36	dami0	there's 4.6.0 and 4.7.0 available there, but the links are dead
2016-03-15 13:47:38	dami0	just thought you should know
2016-03-15 13:48:33	@drobbins	yeah, that is pretty helpful.

2016-03-15 13:51:19	@drobbins	it IS a wiki, it's easy to fix things like that
2016-03-15 13:51:24	@drobbins	but it's fixed now
2016-03-15 13:51:35	dami0	did not know that
2016-03-15 13:51:39	lozenge	i put funtoo on my laptop about 3 weeks or so ago and had to use rescuecd's latest link on their site
2016-03-15 13:52:17	lozenge	prolly should have said something earlier
2016-03-15 13:52:51	terabit	drobbins fyi , emerge -uDNav @world did automask write, when I did dispatch-conf one of the changes was adding +=sys-devel/gcc-5.3.0 to package.unmask
2016-03-15 13:53:35	@drobbins	terabit: did you test gcc-4.9.3-r2?
2016-03-15 13:54:02	terabit	nope

2016-03-16 08:23:47	dami0	hi, do you guys distribute stage 3 by torrent too?
2016-03-16 08:24:44	terabit	heh, why torrent?
2016-03-16 08:24:56	dami0	it usually goes fastest for me
2016-03-16 08:24:57	biberao	terabit: still alive haha
2016-03-16 08:25:09	terabit	biberao: we try :P
2016-03-16 08:25:13	dami0	plus it's p2p so not only is it buzzing with hip lingo it eases load on servers
2016-03-16 08:25:46	terabit	torrents might actually be more secure too
2016-03-16 08:26:30	terabit	been ranting about installation media verification in *nix OS' for a while now
2016-03-16 08:26:39	terabit	gaping security hole
2016-03-16 08:27:01	dami0	that's how the NSA gets your nudes :(
2016-03-16 08:27:03	terabit	distro makers assume users verify  installation media using gpg

2016-03-16 08:27:20	terabit	and gpg itself requires you downloading public key separately
2016-03-16 08:27:30	dami0	sometimes they use hashes
2016-03-16 08:27:39	dami0	but they don't always use https :^)
2016-03-16 08:28:03	terabit	exactly the hash is served to you in http a lot of times
2016-03-16 08:28:26	terabit	so much dependence on user's ability to do security right
2016-03-16 08:28:34	terabit	why not just let them download over https
2016-03-16 08:28:52	terabit	at the very least the initial livecd should be done that way
2016-03-16 08:29:12	terabit	especially given stuff like letsencrypt is around

2016-03-16 08:33:21	dami0	but didn't want to seem like that's why i brought up torrents
2016-03-16 08:34:26	terabit	dami0: I've never explored torrents  from a security point of view, but I do not that it verifies a hash after a download, not sure how the tracker,peers and torrent download url come to play
2016-03-16 08:34:38	terabit	personally I willl settle for a https key

2016-03-16 08:42:36	fs0ciety	 been on funtoo for 3 months now, tried gentoo as well to see the comparision.  i actually prefer funtoo - seems more stable and a little bit more refined even though i have to wait for overlay syncs from gentoo - its great :)
2016-03-16 08:43:56	fs0ciety	i also prefer the smaller community, its actually more helpful than the gentoo forum. which sometimes takes up to a week to get a response.  just wanted to say im enjoying good ol funtoo - and its nice to get away from arch which had been using for 4 years. i was just getting bored :)
2016-03-16 08:44:25	terabit	wouldn't say less buggy ,but the bugs get  responded to pretty quickly :)
2016-03-16 08:45:26	terabit	I never got to try arch, by the time I wanted to  they went all systemd  on me
2016-03-16 08:45:56	fs0ciety	terabit: true - but the funtoo project definetly has more focus :)  i also like how funtoo is more openrc based.  where as default gentoo profiles will silently install systemd files even though youon't use them. haha

2016-03-16 09:05:04	dami0	terabit: well, afaik (not an expert though) if you don't use a magnet link, you have a pretty large hash of the file included in the .torrent
2016-03-16 09:05:24	dami0	the assumption is that the .torrent file is correct
2016-03-16 09:05:46	terabit	but if the site is hosting the .torrent over http...
2016-03-16 09:05:52	dami0	if so, the worst case scenario of everyone around you trying to mess with you will be a file that continually fails to pass the hash check
2016-03-16 09:06:01	dami0	yep
2016-03-16 09:06:02	terabit	they could mitm you into downloading a separate torrent
2016-03-16 09:06:23	dami0	if it's https though, both the direct download and torrent are way more secure
2016-03-16 09:06:24	terabit	it will pass the hash check alright, but you'd be downloading a separate torrent
2016-03-16 09:06:34	terabit	yeah
2016-03-16 09:06:34	dami0	i know what you mean, that's why i stated the assumptiuon

2016-03-16 10:31:52	dami0	above those lines
2016-03-16 10:32:01	dami0	but i think you're going to run into more problems
2016-03-16 10:32:19	Dutch_Master	such as?
2016-03-16 10:32:29	dami0	one way to find out :)
2016-03-16 10:32:36	Dutch_Master	LOL
2016-03-16 10:33:07	Dutch_Master	btw, the PORTA and PORTC declarations are in the line bove
2016-03-16 10:33:55	Dutch_Master	oh wait, that's wrong...
2016-03-16 10:33:59	dami0	not in what i'm looking at
2016-03-16 10:37:35	 < 	spylinux (~spylinux@unaffiliated/spylinux) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.1.1)
2016-03-16 10:38:44	Dutch_Master	well, tried adding "char PORTA, char PORTC" to that line, but then it complains of too few args further on
2016-03-16 10:39:12	dami0	did you write the code?
2016-03-16 10:39:17	Dutch_Master	so, obviously I need to declare them differently, but where and how?
2016-03-16 10:39:40	dami0	the error is probably unrelated
2016-03-16 10:39:41	Dutch_Master	no, I didn't. It's a demo sketch for a TFT screen I bought years ago
2016-03-16 10:39:56	dami0	cool
2016-03-16 10:40:16	Dutch_Master	runs on an Arduino, at least that's the intention :-\
2016-03-16 10:49:38	*	Dutch_Master is reading: http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/27-chars/  Interesting :-)

2016-03-16 11:01:48	dami0	hi
2016-03-16 11:02:28	kameel	I have a new processor and Im not sure which file I need to download
2016-03-16 11:03:24	kameel	wikipedia says the cpu is from skylake arch
2016-03-16 11:03:25	dami0	do you know the full name of the cpu?
2016-03-16 11:04:13	kameel	yea
2016-03-16 11:04:53	dami0	you can look it up on the intel website to make sure what architecture it is
2016-03-16 11:05:05	kameel	this is the output of lscpu Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz

2016-03-17 05:27:47	michaelrose	easiest way to find a current issue is to search for the name of the package and sort by date created
2016-03-17 05:28:11	michaelrose	also note that a given package may not by default come with all the features you might expect or desire
2016-03-17 05:28:36	slacko64_19612	So when I try to chroot into my unpacked stage3 I get this: "env: can't execute '/bin/chroot': No such file or directory"
2016-03-17 05:29:14	@angry_vincent	slacko64_19612: what command used for chroot?
2016-03-17 05:29:21	michaelrose	funtoo/gentoo has something called use flags which enable or disable features of a package
2016-03-17 05:29:41	slacko64_19612	The one on the funtoo/install docs
2016-03-17 05:29:51	michaelrose	if you install equery a useful tool you can run equery uses packagename and it will tell you which uses are enabled/disabled for a package

2016-03-17 06:23:03	michaelrose	you needn't use @ in irc
2016-03-17 06:23:34	michaelrose	it would be useful to know where the error message occurs
2016-03-17 06:23:48	michaelrose	how did you install kodi, and how did you install the addon
2016-03-17 06:27:36	michaelrose	if you want solutions to problems you will need to include all relevant information to allow someone else to provide help
2016-03-17 06:28:18	michaelrose	also if the problem is a kodi problem as opposed to a funtoo problem there is also a channel for kodi

2016-03-17 10:13:00	michaelrose	its actually a tiny script so the easiest way to fix it presently is to wrap it in a virtual env and inside the env install the older versions

2016-03-18 13:24:31	michaelrose	as installed by default it crashes
2016-03-18 13:24:56	michaelrose	the error suggests its because of a lack of a font but manually installing said fonts doesn't appear to work nor changing fonts in its config file

2016-03-18 15:52:55	PaddyMac	Can someone explain to me why the Fedora project releases software that is usable on any Linux distro, but they somehow release that software without any documentation either on their website or in the tarball archive and somehow expect users to magically know how to use that software without any documentation whatsoever/
2016-03-18 15:53:29	michaelrose	Maybe they don't want to make it any easier for oracle to rip them off jk
2016-03-18 15:54:07	PaddyMac	Oracle is evil. I have no doubt about that. But Fedora pisses me off despite me wanting to like them.

2016-03-19 12:37:19	Dutch_Master	that's ok, I'm not really into maths
2016-03-19 12:37:27	sandro_	And ... now i'm not sure but may be that these "laws" may be utiles for videocards ....
2016-03-19 12:37:56	sandro_	but i'm not a math ....

2016-03-19 12:40:53	sandro_	(excuse my incorrect US Language)
2016-03-19 12:41:35	sandro_	Dutch_Master ... you are in chroot now ?
2016-03-19 12:41:58	sandro_	Or ... little space on the partition ?
2016-03-19 12:43:25	Dutch_Master	yeah, I was in the chroot. df -h told me some 75% used, so I don't get it.
2016-03-19 12:43:52	sandro_	what tells `df -h` ?
2016-03-19 12:45:57	Dutch_Master	it was about 75% used (of 3.6GB) so emerge *should* have completed
2016-03-19 12:46:02	sandro_	May be an idea to delete /usr/portage/distfiles and /var/tmp/portage (in chroot) ?
2016-03-19 12:46:13	sandro_	Ah ok....
2016-03-19 12:46:24	Dutch_Master	I'll try a Gentoo stage3 tarball tomorrow

2016-03-19 12:47:04	sandro_	Ok Great Dutch_Master :)
2016-03-19 12:48:26	sandro_	Since i've 16 GiB Ram, i compile all in ram; but if i'm in chroot i , sometimes, must "comment" in make.conf the "PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/dev/shm" ....
2016-03-19 12:48:32	sandro_	and use the disk
2016-03-19 12:48:54	sandro_	wow ... > 300 ebuilds compiled :)

2016-03-19 22:05:50	lautriv__	angry_vincent, about FL-3027 using mdadm instead mdstart ... yes i used mdadm instead but not with genkernel, since genkernel failed i did my own initramfs which calls mdadm. afair genkernel did provide all binaries but the script doesn't call it where it was a leftover from the old days atempting to create smaller ramdisks.

2016-03-20 02:36:49	tsmith	I have a big problem. I am running Funtoo for years on a dedicated server that's on production. Somehow, my funtoo distro thinks it's gentoo now. When I run emerge --sync, it complains of it being a .git repo.
2016-03-20 02:37:02	tsmith	emerge is completely broken. I need assistance lol
2016-03-20 02:37:26	tsmith	it says  sys-apps/portage-2.4.0::gentoo is emerged...
2016-03-20 02:39:53	ZombieChicken	I seem to recall Funtoo has to use the Gentoo repo name for some weird reason. I wish I could help you more, but that is all the info I have right now
2016-03-20 02:40:00	tsmith	 Installed versions:  2.4.1(05:34:28 PM 03/14/2016)(ipc xattr -build -doc -epydoc -selinux LINGUAS="-ru" PYTHON_TARGETS="python2_7 python3_4 -pypy -python3_3 -python3_5")
2016-03-20 02:40:23	tsmith	I'm pretty sure that's when my system fucked up
2016-03-20 02:41:21	@angry_vincent	ZombieChicken: it's not for some reason, it's always had gentoo repo name
2016-03-20 02:42:23	@angry_vincent	tsmith: what's your problem. can you describe it without using f-words?
2016-03-20 02:42:43	tsmith	haha i'm sorry. I didn't mean to trigger anyone haha
2016-03-20 02:43:02	tsmith	I have a problem where emerge --sync pulls in Gentoo via rsync instead of Funtoo via git.

2016-03-20 03:00:48	tsmith	i swear, i did an emerge --sync and i have no idea how i ended up with a gentoo system
2016-03-20 03:01:09	tsmith	i've been using funtoo since around the first few months it was released, on production systems, i'm not exactly a noob
2016-03-20 03:01:13	@angry_vincent	you need to paste another file i asked

2016-03-20 03:03:31	tsmith	I have all of my /etc files committed into git. Are you striving for clarity through explictness or is English not your native language?
2016-03-20 03:03:54	@angry_vincent	first
2016-03-20 03:03:58	tsmith	OK awesome.

2016-03-20 03:19:47	@angry_vincent	right, you don't need the one with rsync
2016-03-20 03:19:58	@angry_vincent	i don't know how it's added on your system
2016-03-20 03:20:10	@angry_vincent	mybe manually somehow

2016-03-20 06:36:23	sandro_	if You want to use "gentoo-sources" , to have more then:

2016-03-20 06:37:02	stakewinner00	in theory there are debina-sources 4.2.6 but when i do emerge -avuDN @world it never upgrades the kernel...

2016-03-20 06:40:06	stakewinner00	lautriv__, is there some problem if i part from debian-sources to build my own kernel'
2016-03-20 06:40:46	lautriv__	stakewinner00, debians default defconfig is "with all in" , you will load thing which can't not even fit that box.
2016-03-20 06:41:55	stakewinner00	i'm currently using debian-source linux 3.19 and it works, so if i part from this and remove useless things, i think i can avoid problems. If i start from nothing and forget to enable some drivers i will have problems
2016-03-20 06:42:39	lautriv__	sure. using your working .config and removing part by part is the savest bet.

2016-03-20 07:25:28	jwpierce3	stakewinner00, download OR install?
2016-03-20 07:26:00	stakewinner00	download to manually configure it, "make" it and install it.
2016-03-20 07:26:31	jwpierce3	when you install a kernel source, all it does is download, apply patches, and place source in /usr/src
2016-03-20 07:27:08	jwpierce3	currently there are only three versions in portage proper, 3.19.3 4.0.4 4.2.6
2016-03-20 07:27:51	jwpierce3	you would do an "emerge =net-misc/debian-sources-(version)"
2016-03-20 07:28:02	jwpierce3	you would do an "emerge =sys-kernel/debian-sources-(version)"
2016-03-20 07:28:57	stakewinner00	"sys-kernel/debian-sources-4.2.6 not found" i think i write it correct
2016-03-20 07:29:18	jwpierce3	emerge --sync to update portage
2016-03-20 07:29:30	stakewinner00	i have do it
2016-03-20 07:29:54	jwpierce3	you can find what your system has by "ls /usr/portage/sys-kernel/debian-sources"

2016-03-20 07:39:18	jwpierce3	stakewinner00, ok so if you want to use debian-sources without building automatically you must apply negative use flag "-binary" You must also unmask version 4.2.6 as well
2016-03-20 07:39:29	stakewinner00	i done it

2016-03-20 10:12:47	sandro_	for "Current" have you tried "emerge -1 =dev-qt/linguist-4.8.7" ?
2016-03-20 10:14:08	sandro_	However in Portage there is also the 5.5.1-r1
2016-03-20 10:16:12	sandro_	tsermyat: now i'm on Stable with kde 4.X and i'm compiling linguist to see if i can reproduce your errors.....

2016-03-20 10:48:02	sandro_	but the linguist-5.x requires qt5 then in my system doesn't work cause i've a "-qt5" in make.confe since i use the Kde 4.X with qt4; then now i try to compile linguist-4.x
2016-03-20 10:51:03	tsermyat	sandro_: id on't need -4 i need 5
2016-03-20 10:51:31	sandro_	Ah ok ......
2016-03-20 10:52:50	sandro_	How are your C, CXX , FF , CFC - FLAGS ?
2016-03-20 10:53:09	sandro_	in the output i've seen a -Ofast....
2016-03-20 10:53:35	sandro_	and -ffasth-math mey break the compilation
2016-03-20 10:54:03	sandro_	(-Ofast = -O3 -ffast-math)
2016-03-20 10:55:04	sandro_	or ... other idea, report in bugs.funtoo.org :)

2016-03-20 10:56:29	tsermyat	that's why i asked here
2016-03-20 10:56:34	sandro_	what are your *FLAGS in make.conf
2016-03-20 10:56:35	tsermyat	maybe i can try to install from fun2
2016-03-20 10:56:38	sandro_	?
2016-03-20 10:56:39	tsermyat	what do u think?

2016-03-21 09:22:52	mingdao	WilliamH: I just checked on another Gentoo box ... this changed from 0.11.1 to 0.12.1
2016-03-21 09:22:56	@WilliamH	mingdao: you were probably using a token earlier. Do you have a file, .bugz_token or .bugz_tokens?
2016-03-21 09:23:54	@WilliamH	mingdao: If you do have that, yes, pybugz no longer uses it.

2016-03-21 11:08:38	home_	its a new card
2016-03-21 11:08:45	home_	I just want to test that it works krushia
2016-03-21 11:09:03	krushia	i tried and failed
2016-03-21 11:09:28	krushia	it needs a lot of package versions to line up just right iirc
2016-03-21 11:09:56	krushia	not as horrible as intel though

2016-03-21 11:14:32	kcodyjr	asked another way, since i'm sure a rasp pi 2 spec stage will boot, what do i have to do to start manually building an arm8 stage?
2016-03-21 11:18:22	reisio	uh, sorry which rpi have you?
2016-03-21 11:18:44	kcodyjr	the rpi 3 that just came out
2016-03-21 11:19:16	reisio	3 b?
2016-03-21 11:19:34	kcodyjr	believe so, i think that's the only 3 you can actually buy right now
2016-03-21 11:19:42	reisio	silly of them
2016-03-21 11:20:15	reisio	I'd assume these instructions still apply, only s/v[67]/v8/ as desired: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi
2016-03-21 11:20:22	reisio	/msg alis list *gent*arm
2016-03-21 11:21:13	kcodyjr	that's my assumption too
2016-03-21 11:21:28	home_	oh, is it for sale yet? nice
2016-03-21 11:21:33	kcodyjr	at this point i'm trying to build a qemu vm to do package building since i'm sure that'll be faster than native compiling
2016-03-21 11:22:57	reisio	yeah, I always thought using qemu would be less of a PITA than using cross compiling
2016-03-21 11:22:57	kcodyjr	though "-march=native" would be a cheap way out of this, but then the question still is, which is the right stage to start with
2016-03-21 11:23:23	kcodyjr	realistically i don't see cross compiling building the entire package set, all the instructions for cross involve using distcc.
2016-03-21 11:23:37	kcodyjr	in other words the cross-compile toolchain only works for gcc, not for all of portage
2016-03-21 11:23:43	kcodyjr	far as i know
2016-03-21 11:23:46	 < 	FireBurn (~FireBurn@no-sources/fireburn) has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2016-03-21 11:24:05	reisio	all I see is '32-bit arm' downloads
2016-03-21 11:24:08	reisio	for Funtoo
2016-03-21 11:24:24	reisio	I'm guessing any will work, all being older than v8
2016-03-21 11:24:37	kcodyjr	since raspbian (vomit) seems to have one distribution working for all 3, it seems safe-ish, maybe, to use the one spec'ed for rpi 2
2016-03-21 11:24:54	reisio	raspbian is antiquated
2016-03-21 11:25:03	reisio	it came to be because Debian didn't support the original rpi arch
2016-03-21 11:25:07	reisio	but Debian supports 2+
2016-03-21 11:25:22	reisio	just another unnecessary derivative distro at this point
2016-03-21 11:25:24	kcodyjr	anything debian makes the hairs on my neck stand up
2016-03-21 11:25:41	kcodyjr	though i've accepted my girlfriend running mint. at least it's not windows.
2016-03-21 11:26:09	kcodyjr	so, straight debian works on the rpi3? does that mean i can hope for a vanilla kernel to work?
2016-03-21 11:27:02	home_	need to fix audio
2016-03-21 11:27:36	home_	run raspbian on it
2016-03-21 11:27:53	reisio	I would think armhf would work for both rpi2 and rpi3
2016-03-21 11:27:54	home_	it comes with the NOOBS installer, that has decent configuration options
2016-03-21 11:27:56	reisio	easily tested
2016-03-21 11:28:07	reisio	I wouldn't actually buy an rpi anymore
2016-03-21 11:28:19	home_	reisio, why? they are pretty good for the price
2016-03-21 11:28:21	reisio	I got one for my folks, years ago, and one for my friends, just because it's the classic example of an SBC
2016-03-21 11:28:26	home_	and the alternatives are on kickstarters >.>
2016-03-21 11:28:29	reisio	but x86 computers of similar qualities are almost the same price now
2016-03-21 11:28:35	reisio	and far less problematic/underpowered
2016-03-21 11:28:48	home_	really? what x86 can you get for around $20-$35?
2016-03-21 11:28:50	reisio	the power consumption is less important to me than the size and solid stateness
2016-03-21 11:28:59	reisio	home_: you can't get an rpi for $20-$35
2016-03-21 11:29:03	reisio	not one that does anything
2016-03-21 11:29:20	kcodyjr	the rpi3 itself was $35
2016-03-21 11:29:23	reisio	for about $40 more than an rpi with all the peripherals it needs, you can get an x86 that's about a zillion times more powerful, and roughly the same size
2016-03-21 11:29:27	kcodyjr	plus case, sd card, and power supply
2016-03-21 11:29:43	reisio	(and has no arm problems [with netflix, etc.])
2016-03-21 11:29:44	home_	reisio, name the x86..I want to know since I might buy it
2016-03-21 11:29:49	home_	don't keep that info to yourself :)
2016-03-21 11:30:05	reisio	home_: last time I looked, you could get a gigabyte brix off amazon for that price difference; I'm sure if you looked harder you could find a better deal
2016-03-21 11:30:12	reisio	within $40 of an rpi is cheap enough for me
2016-03-21 11:30:27	kcodyjr	well, i made a conscious choice to play with arm
2016-03-21 11:30:38	reisio	all the hardware guys I know say arm is a lovely arch
2016-03-21 11:30:48	kcodyjr	i'm trying to see how good a funtoo desktop i can build with it at work
2016-03-21 11:30:49	reisio	but all the things I do are so high level, it's hard for me to be arsed to appreciate that
2016-03-21 11:31:07	kcodyjr	if it flies, i'll spring for the vesa case to mount it right to the back of the monitor and maybe even see if it's built in usb hub will power the rpi3
2016-03-21 11:31:13	reisio	and I mostly use little single-board computers for other people... and I really hate dealing with Netflix/et al. issues with arm
2016-03-21 11:31:41	home_	use Kodi with rpi
2016-03-21 11:31:46	home_	that's what most people use it for ..hehe
2016-03-21 11:31:49	reisio	and now there's h.265 to deal with, which no rpi supports yet, AFAIK
2016-03-21 11:31:56	reisio	yeah, and it works well that way
2016-03-21 11:32:00	kcodyjr	right now i do most of my work on a trashbook pro inside a centos vm. it's terminal windows and the occasional browser pointing to an internal web app.
2016-03-21 11:32:06	reisio	but a +$40 x86 with kodi works better
2016-03-21 11:32:38	kcodyjr	i don't need the power of an intel for that, when i've got a ballsy centos kvm cluster downstairs
2016-03-21 11:33:48	reisio	the extra power is just a bonus
2016-03-21 11:33:53	reisio	what you get, for only $40 more, is:
2016-03-21 11:33:55	reisio	no arm problems
2016-03-21 11:34:01	reisio	an ordinary damned hard disk if you want one
2016-03-21 11:34:06	home_	gonna try this here : https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7534494.html
2016-03-21 11:34:11	reisio	ordinary graphics capabilities
2016-03-21 11:34:21	reisio	no dealing with qemu or crossdev
2016-03-21 11:34:30	reisio	it's well, WELL worth $$0
2016-03-21 11:34:31	reisio	$40
2016-03-21 11:34:45	reisio	the only use case it wouldn't be worth it for is something /tiny/ and battery powered
2016-03-21 11:34:46	home_	I haven't seen a $40 x86
2016-03-21 11:34:50	reisio	which is far outside of any scope I yet have
2016-03-21 11:34:57	reisio	home_: $40 more than an rpi
2016-03-21 11:35:18	home_	oh, why would I want to spend more money on something that's not needed?
2016-03-21 11:35:21	kcodyjr	i won't get any momentum on big power hungry boxes at the office
2016-03-21 11:35:30	kcodyjr	but i might be able to start a desktop rpi trend
2016-03-21 11:36:23	reisio	home_: I just gave a multitude of reasons, is why
2016-03-21 11:36:47	reisio	"more power than what an rpi uses" isn't exactly the definition of power hungry, either
2016-03-21 11:37:02	reisio	you will use a lot more "power" in the form of effort and troubleshooting and cross compiling
2016-03-21 11:37:05	reisio	getting your arm systems to work
2016-03-21 11:39:39	home_	yeah, that's why you stick to using raspbian and other binary oses.
2016-03-21 11:39:57	home_	since it doesn't have a lot of power available to it
2016-03-21 11:40:46	home_	just install whatever available package it has, and you are good to go.
2016-03-21 11:43:58	reisio	that argument is a little out of place here :p
2016-03-21 11:48:09	kcodyjr	i wouldn't have put it so politely, thanks reisio
2016-03-21 11:48:21	kcodyjr	if push comes to shove i'll native build and that'll be that
2016-03-21 11:48:49	kcodyjr	though i note that the rpi3 is arm8 64-bit so presumably the best i'll get is a 32-bit arm8 build using -march=native and the rpi2 stages

2016-03-21 11:49:43	kcodyjr	that's how i feel about debian.
2016-03-21 11:49:48	reisio	anyway, you can always do a "stage3" for any arch you like
2016-03-21 11:49:51	home_	kcodyjr, its 64 bit
2016-03-21 11:49:52	reisio	how I feel about both
2016-03-21 11:49:58	kcodyjr	fair enough
2016-03-21 11:50:00	reisio	home_: yes
2016-03-21 11:50:07	reisio	erm, whoops
2016-03-21 11:50:09	reisio	a "stage1"
2016-03-21 11:50:15	kcodyjr	i can generate an arm8 stage1? how?
2016-03-21 11:51:07	kcodyjr	i've got a reasonably powerful x86_64 funtoo box standing by, if i can emerge a buncha shit and run a few commands and spit out a stage1, let's get started

2016-03-21 11:52:10	kcodyjr	i did gentoo installs from stage1 many times, what i don't know is how to generate the stage1
2016-03-21 11:52:26	reisio	well, the reason they discontinued stage1 tarballs is because they were the same as stage3 rebuilt
2016-03-21 11:52:34	reisio	so it was a total waste of time if there was a stage3 at all
2016-03-21 11:52:39	reisio	except for exotic arches
2016-03-21 11:52:52	reisio	which have no stage3 :p

2016-03-21 11:57:07	reisio	you really just need /any/ 64-bit arm environment to re/build from
2016-03-21 11:57:39	kcodyjr	i'm not following, how do i use that guy's gentoo stage to create a funtoo stage?
2016-03-21 11:57:44	reisio	actually I take it back
2016-03-21 11:57:50	reisio	there's no arm64 in portage :p
2016-03-21 11:58:02	reisio	need packages first, or there's no point
2016-03-21 11:59:19	kcodyjr	right
2016-03-21 11:59:26	kcodyjr	ok, so running 64-bit is out for the time being
2016-03-21 11:59:42	kcodyjr	i'm fine with that, it's only got a gig of ram
2016-03-21 12:01:04	kcodyjr	obviously the cpu will run in 32-bit mode or it wouldn't have booted raspbian
2016-03-21 12:01:42	kcodyjr	so i should just treat it as an rpi2 with a faster clock.

2016-03-21 12:15:17	home	orrrr
2016-03-21 12:15:19	home	use raspbian
2016-03-21 12:15:36	kcodyjr	ain't that heresy in this channel?
2016-03-21 12:15:43	home	maybe actually use what the RPI endorses for their main product?
2016-03-21 12:15:43	*	kcodyjr throws something at home
2016-03-21 12:15:56	kcodyjr	by that logic we all should have stuck with windows on our intel boxes
2016-03-21 12:16:06	home	it comes with a bunch of configuration and scripts that run on that specific os
2016-03-21 12:16:59	home	kcodyjr, and the RPI community mainly endorses the use of raspbian...and if you are giving it to friends & family, it would be a good idea to not dick around with it too much.

2016-03-21 12:50:03	jwpierce3	reisio, well I'm pretty sure it's effin wrong. Why would someone declare make install "install prefixes" with portage temp locations.
2016-03-21 12:50:41	reisio	most things are effin wrong
2016-03-21 12:50:47	reisio	<3 humanity? :p
2016-03-21 12:51:37	jwpierce3	besides the make install the ebuild in question looks pretty good to my untrained eyes :)

2016-03-21 13:52:28	therickaman	Hi, I have a quick question...I need to use a program that only has binaries.  It was compiled for only 32 bit, but I am currently using pure64 thus no multilib support.  How can I update funtoo to add multilib support since now I know that I actually need it?
2016-03-21 13:55:58	reisio	http://jkroon.blogs.uls.co.za/it/gentoo/gentoo-converting-no-multilib-to-multilib etc.
2016-03-21 13:59:31	therickaman	wow
2016-03-21 13:59:47	reisio	probably take longer than "reinstalling"
2016-03-21 14:00:23	therickaman	is it possible to use virtual box and install say, ubuntu (quick), and then use the program within virtual box?
2016-03-21 14:01:04	therickaman	or would the system running within virtual box be confined to the system's lack of multilib?
2016-03-21 14:01:52	reisio	should work fine

2016-03-21 14:02:23	reisio	sounds like a lot of work to put off fixing your profile, though
2016-03-21 14:02:49	home	life :D
2016-03-21 14:03:09	therickaman	:) I eventually need to fix the profile
2016-03-21 14:03:30	therickaman	I plan to reinstall later, but lack the time at the moment

2016-03-21 14:04:27	therickaman	it would be easy, but I need to share a file with my amazon fire stick using the network.  I have a very minimal install right now.
2016-03-21 14:06:13	therickaman	so, I decided to use adbFire, but I have no multilib lol
2016-03-21 14:06:41	therickaman	could use wife's windoze machine, but now...I'm interested in solving the problem on this one

2016-03-21 14:56:36	jwpierce3	Ok so I figured out that ${D} is "Path to the temporary install directory. Value: "${PORTAGE_BUILDDIR}/image" " Problem I am having is that the opensips developers are creating script binaries from make install. So therefore the portage temp paths are being captured by said binaries
2016-03-21 14:57:14	jwpierce3	well, there're not really binaries, but whatever

2016-03-21 23:53:14	fs0ciety	ahh okay
2016-03-21 23:54:11	@angry_vincent	webkitgtk-3.0 is  WebKit1 API which is 2.4.x* version
2016-03-21 23:54:31	@angry_vincent	newer are WebKit2 API
2016-03-21 23:54:44	fs0ciety	thanks for that was slightly confused cause there was also a "4" slot
2016-03-21 23:55:14	@angry_vincent	its perhaps for libwebkit2gtk-4.0
2016-03-21 23:55:22	@angry_vincent	2.6 and above

2016-03-22 04:15:26	@angry_vincent	it is masked because the ebuild during installation trying to install other packages. i.e accessing internet and doing somthing, which ebuild shouldn't do
2016-03-22 04:15:51	@angry_vincent	maybe its' now changed and ebuild is good?

2016-03-22 04:57:50	jk0er	I'm having some trouble setting up NetworkManager, i get a "(32) Private connection already active on the device: uid 1000 has no permission to perform this operation" error in nm-applet. Has anyone any idea how to fix this?
2016-03-22 04:59:58	jwpierce3	angry_vincent, I'm working with a "make --options" & "make install paths" package. ${D} is used in the make install, however the package produces some scripts that are relocated to /usr/sbin. When they are created, they are grabbing the portage install temp locations as a result of ${D}. How can I correct this behavior?

2016-03-24 01:48:58	proteusguy_sat2	I'm trying to get an ebuild file that will let me install app-emulation/docker version 1.10.3. 1.10.0 is the one available now. Besides copying the file and changing the GIT version, what else do I need to do to avoid this result? https://bpaste.net/show/44dbd83a047b
2016-03-24 01:49:51	@angry_vincent	updte manifest

2016-03-24 12:47:05	@funfool	last I paid attention to clang (couple years) was still buggy and needed lots of work
2016-03-24 12:48:32	Hell-Razor	I am just really into building android atm, I think its fun and whatnot but I cant ind much about it at the idiot level
2016-03-24 12:49:04	Hell-Razor	And lots of issues Im running into are clang related
2016-03-24 12:49:55	Hell-Razor	Well sigh. I think I need to rm -rf my directory again and re-sync it all... lol
2016-03-24 13:01:12	Hell-Razor	I am about ready to throw my computer out the window. Why is this so difficult!
2016-03-24 13:01:59	PaddyMac	Hell-Razor: Support is being worked on. Here's the Clang tracker: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=408963
2016-03-24 13:03:03	Hell-Razor	PaddyMac over two years ago was the last update =/
2016-03-24 13:03:36	PaddyMac	But right now, gcc is still more reliable. Still, you can use Clang if you want. Just set your CC and CXX variables in make.conf
2016-03-24 13:03:50	PaddyMac	No, the last update on that bug was November 1, 2015.
2016-03-24 13:04:18	Hell-Razor	Oh. Yeah I should give it a shot
2016-03-24 13:04:36	PaddyMac	This bug https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417789 was last updated 2 years ago, but that's specifically for Gentoo/FreeBSD.
2016-03-24 13:05:03	Hell-Razor	I was debating about switching to BSD but I am not sure how compiling would work for android on it

2016-03-24 13:06:37	PaddyMac	I tinkered with FreeBSD a few months ago. It was okay, but I prefer the ease of Portage. Still, to be fair, I didn't try any of FreeBSD's port management utilities.
2016-03-24 13:07:06	Hell-Razor	I thought bsd had the ability to use something like portage. I never gave it a shot
2016-03-24 13:07:42	Hell-Razor	I never gave bsd a shot*
2016-03-24 13:08:01	PaddyMac	Really, my main complaint about FreeBSD was that it's somewhat more poorly supported by software. To put it anothr way, some of the software I wanted to use would work on Linux but not FreeBSD.

2016-03-24 13:08:48	Hell-Razor	Yeah. I probably wont give it a shot. TBH I will probably go to doze before I do BSD
2016-03-24 13:09:28	Hell-Razor	But back to my android issues. I am just pissed off at this stupid thing.

2016-03-24 13:10:47	Hell-Razor	I wish people would write more how-tos for scrubs
2016-03-24 13:12:02	PaddyMac	Unfortunately, I don't know anything about developing for Android. I only have a little experience cross-compiling on Linuux, and that was just for x86 on an x86_64 machine.
2016-03-24 13:13:17	Hell-Razor	Its not your fault lol. I am just tired of some of the attitudes of some devs where its "I figured it out, you can too".

2016-03-24 13:18:15	PaddyMac	Yeah. I went on a rant on a github bug a few days ago because the dev basically just told me to buy a new computer to fix my issue. It didn't help that I'd had a few beers when I read his reply.
2016-03-24 13:18:41	Hell-Razor	Heh
2016-03-24 13:19:04	Hell-Razor	I got banned from #gentoo for a rant as well. I was super pissed
2016-03-24 13:19:11	mingdao	by who?
2016-03-24 13:19:20	Hell-Razor	Hmm
2016-03-24 13:19:31	Hell-Razor	A op that never talks
2016-03-24 13:19:36	Hell-Razor	I cant remember who
2016-03-24 13:20:44	Hell-Razor	omfg. clang: error: no such file or directory: ' '.. Its looking for a null directory. What the hell is this crap lol

2016-03-24 13:28:41	PaddyMac	My rant was on github. I haven't visited since then. But unless github has somewhay to ban people, I'm pretty sure I haven't.
2016-03-24 13:29:36	Hell-Razor	Oh I thought you meant #git
2016-03-24 13:30:45	PaddyMac	No. Anyway, I'm totally exhausted, and I'm going to bed. Good night.

2016-03-24 22:26:41	yann-kaelig	Hi,
2016-03-24 22:28:22	yann-kaelig	Is there a good reason to plasma-meta ebuild force to use a display manager ? The startx methode do not work ?
2016-03-24 22:29:34	yann-kaelig	The ssdm ebuild is masked, but removing the USE ssdm force to use lightdm

2016-03-24 22:30:10	@angry_vincent	if you use plasma profile, sddm is not masked
2016-03-24 22:30:19	Juippis	startx does work, but -meta install everything
2016-03-24 22:30:24	@angry_vincent	startx works
2016-03-24 22:31:16	yann-kaelig	angry_vincent, Hi. The plasma profile is kde4-libs compatible ?
2016-03-24 22:31:32	@angry_vincent	i don't think o
2016-03-24 22:31:33	@angry_vincent	so
2016-03-24 22:31:51	@angry_vincent	but you have certain parts of older packages still
2016-03-24 22:31:55	yann-kaelig	ha! that couldbe interstinf if is not. Because I don't want them
2016-03-24 22:32:33	@angry_vincent	are you updating or want plasma 5 install clean
2016-03-24 22:32:39	yann-kaelig	clean install
2016-03-24 22:32:52	@angry_vincent	then you can just have new packages
2016-03-24 22:32:55	yann-kaelig	I really want a minimal plasma5 installation
2016-03-24 22:32:57	@angry_vincent	qt5, etc
2016-03-24 22:33:13	kensington	yann-kaelig: it doesn't force it, there's display-manager USE flag
2016-03-24 22:33:14	@angry_vincent	but if you want kde-apps, they could still use older libs
2016-03-24 22:33:30	@angry_vincent	yann-kaelig: it looks like you want to avoid display-manager USE
2016-03-24 22:33:39	yann-kaelig	I don't want any kde-apps, just the minimal DE
2016-03-24 22:33:40	@angry_vincent	it pulls sddm
2016-03-24 22:33:59	@angry_vincent	emerge plasma-meta
2016-03-24 22:34:52	yann-kaelig	angry_vincent, ha! yes i see that. lets try without this USE

2016-03-25 06:11:35	reisio	differences with USE will be far more significant, IME

2016-03-25 06:16:11	reisio	it's just a convenience, a real big one, if you want to use the binaries on more than one box
2016-03-25 06:16:36	reisio	and again, the benefits of USE are far greater than those of CFLAGS customizations
2016-03-25 06:17:21	sandro	reisio: take a look http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7574/3/
2016-03-25 06:18:11	reisio	sandro: those are real, but I doubt a human would notice the difference for the most part
2016-03-25 06:18:28	reisio	a human _would_ notice that Xfce isn't running gconf and a million other GNOME things, necessarily
2016-03-25 06:18:39	reisio	which is a potential benefit of USE flags

2016-03-25 06:26:03	sandro	:)
2016-03-25 06:26:40	sandro	it is not a simply thing to optimize one system .... but Portage make easy to relize it ....
2016-03-25 06:27:21	sandro	easier* (excuse my bad US lang :( )
2016-03-25 06:28:43	sandro	However .. i've ~ 1750 ebuilds; and i can tell that my Funtoo "Stable" , for me is a "Very Stable System") :)
2016-03-25 06:29:16	reisio	yup, crazy stable
2016-03-25 06:29:21	reisio	Gentoo systems are so boringly stable
2016-03-25 06:29:52	sandro	Is my "first" system .... also my father (78 years old prefers Funtoo than Windows or other distro's :D)
2016-03-25 06:30:14	sandro	and it isn't expert about systems ....

2016-03-25 06:31:35	reisio	I do find that basically any people who aren't irrationally addicted to the particular quirks of a particular win32 application prefer GNU/Linux
2016-03-25 06:31:52	reisio	no I prefer the stable, but it's super fun when I accidentally break something
2016-03-25 06:31:59	reisio	it's a little, rare adventure
2016-03-25 06:32:43	sandro	beh .... "circular dependencies" for me are fun :D

2016-03-25 06:51:31	sandro	Going from 6502 to 65C02 for a few more instructions, I saw how they could gain more performance by optimizing the algorithms for specific cpu. So even before you know the "source-based" systems I always had the thought of having to find ways to be able to maximize the binary code for your cpu.

2016-03-25 12:04:01	carlosj	I'm on the "Chroot into Funtoo" section of the install wiki page. Running # env -i HOME=/root TERM=$TERM chroot . bash -l makes zsh complain about an illegal hardware instruction.
2016-03-25 12:05:11	meingtsla	Can you show the output of "uname -a" and "cat /proc/cpuinfo"? Also, which stage3 did you grab?
2016-03-25 12:06:37	carlosj	sure
2016-03-25 12:08:16	carlosj	meingtsla: http://pastebin.com/evkiY2eP
2016-03-25 12:09:07	carlosj	The stage3 three I used was intel64-sandrybridge-funtoo-current

2016-03-25 12:11:15	meingtsla	Hm. I guess technically that is a sandybridge, though I would expect sandybridge to work on something more like an E3/E5/E7 v2 or i3/i5/i7 2xxx
2016-03-25 12:12:35	carlosj	I checked the intel site and my newegg order from when I got it. Everywhere it says sandybridge. But it's a pentium.
2016-03-25 12:12:52	meingtsla	Might be good to see what instruction exactly it's breaking on, if you're up into investigating it.  But if you just want to get it working, I would just get the generic stage3
2016-03-25 12:13:02	meingtsla	s/up into/up to/
2016-03-25 12:13:25	meingtsla	http://ark.intel.com/products/53483 says "Intel® AES New Instructions     No"
2016-03-25 12:13:27	carlosj	to do get the generic I would have to start over the install?
2016-03-25 12:15:15	meingtsla	You'll want to unmount the filesystem you untarred the previous stage3 to, then re-make the filesystem on that partition. Then remount things, then untar the generic stage3
2016-03-25 12:17:09	carlosj	understood and thanks, that would have taken me a while to figure out

2016-03-25 19:13:45	Arfrever	chry: There is no "selinux" USE flag in sec-policy/selinux-base-policy.
2016-03-25 19:16:25	Arfrever	chry: Maybe rebuilding of sec-policy/selinux-base-policy only once was sufficient.
2016-03-25 19:17:02	chry	Yeah, you're right...
2016-03-25 19:18:18	chry	After libselinux was rebuilt, it was probably neccessary for selinux-base-policy to be rebuilt as well...makes sense...
2016-03-25 19:20:13	chry	Prior to all that, selinux-base-policy was indeed built with FEATURES="-selinux", which is why portage didn't get it in the merge along with the rest of the @world...because USE="selinux" didn't have any effect on selinux-base-policy...

2016-03-25 22:49:28	kensington	PaddyMac: nothing radical but a nice improvement
2016-03-25 22:52:50	PaddyMac	I'm still not sure how I feel about it. 6 has brought in a lot of significant changes that completely break earlier EAPI-compliant ebuilds.
2016-03-25 22:55:18	PaddyMac	I'm trying to bring my ebuild-writing up to spec, and this is the steepest learning curve I've ever experienced from one EAPI change to the next.
2016-03-25 22:57:10	@angry_vincent	use 5
2016-03-25 22:57:21	@angry_vincent	i see no real improvements in 6
2016-03-25 22:58:13	PaddyMac	So stick with 5 at least until 7 comes out, eh?
2016-03-25 22:59:00	@angry_vincent	i see not much point in eapi bumps whn you deal with ebuilds
2016-03-25 22:59:11	@angry_vincent	if it works with 5, it could be 5
2016-03-25 22:59:16	@angry_vincent	until it's banned
2016-03-25 22:59:33	@angry_vincent	you rule your ebuild
2016-03-25 22:59:45	@angry_vincent	if you want 6, make it work with 6
2016-03-25 23:04:14	PaddyMac	Well, I'll need to learn how to use the new EAPIs eventually even if it isn't necessary immediately. Honestly my biggest surprise so far has been finding out that the games and autotools-utils eclasses are banned in EAPI 6.
2016-03-25 23:08:38	PaddyMac	But oh well, I'll have to get ready for work shortly...and after 2 hours of sleep last night. Yay insomnia! I've actually been sleeping well the past week or so. Then I had a bit of an argument on the phone last evening.
2016-03-25 23:08:39	kensington	the eclass changes are done by their respective maintainers who are using a new EAPI to make breaking changes without risk to existing ebuilds
2016-03-25 23:09:31	PaddyMac	kensington: You do have a point there.
2016-03-25 23:09:34	kensington	autotools-utils was decided by the maintainer to no longer really be necessary, and games was banned by the council
2016-03-25 23:11:00	PaddyMac	I don't so much mind the eclasses being banned so much as I find the lack of any guidance regarding alternative ways of handling things previously handled by the banned eclasses.
2016-03-25 23:11:35	@angry_vincent	there was a page
2016-03-25 23:11:49	kensington	in most cases it's "do nothing"
2016-03-25 23:11:53	PaddyMac	I did find some help such as Michal Gorny's Ultimate Guide to EAPI 6. But it doesn't have all the info I need.
2016-03-25 23:12:09	@angry_vincent	yes, deal with him
2016-03-25 23:13:39	kensington	most of the functionality (DOCS, PATCHES, ...) is handled now by default
2016-03-25 23:15:43	PaddyMac	That ought to simplify things in the long run.

2016-03-25 23:16:56	PaddyMac	In the past, I mainly used autotools-utils.eclass because I had to use the eautoreconf function it provided. Is that provided by default now too?
2016-03-25 23:17:31	kensington	eautoreconf is provided by autotools, not autotools-utils
2016-03-25 23:17:59	PaddyMac	OK. So autotools.eclass is still around, then?
2016-03-25 23:18:08	@angry_vincent	yes
2016-03-25 23:18:30	@angry_vincent	i don't think it going away in forseeable future
2016-03-25 23:19:21	kensington	there's no need to rush out and change everything to a new eapi, but incremental upgrades as things are otherwise touched is a good idea
2016-03-25 23:21:23	@angry_vincent	wow, lumina added to tree
2016-03-25 23:21:29	@angry_vincent	i might try it
2016-03-25 23:21:49	@angry_vincent	somehow i'm not impressed with lxqt
2016-03-25 23:22:01	PaddyMac	I've been a bit interested in Lumina myself since the guys on BSD Now occasionally talk about it.

2016-03-25 23:23:03	kensington	it fails to build for me
2016-03-25 23:23:23	@angry_vincent	:(
2016-03-25 23:23:34	@angry_vincent	why it's added to tree then?

2016-03-25 23:24:45	@angry_vincent	ok, then your box is somehow different from the box of a packager?
2016-03-25 23:24:56	@angry_vincent	how? newer qt5?

2016-03-25 23:25:53	@angry_vincent	qt-5.6.0 seems giving lot of headaches
2016-03-25 23:26:12	kensington	i'm not convinced it's related, failure looks more like c++11 related

2016-03-26 05:00:34	@angry_vincent	chry: a fix (or workaround) was to rebuild some package?
2016-03-26 05:00:52	chry	selinux-base-policy, yes.
2016-03-26 05:01:15	@angry_vincent	why do you think rebuilding of this package fixed?
2016-03-26 05:01:31	@angry_vincent	like it was incosistent on your box
2016-03-26 05:01:33	@angry_vincent	?
2016-03-26 05:03:15	chry	Well, when implementing SELinux there are several packages that need to be rebuilt when certain settings change, but in this case I think it needed to be rebuilt due to libselinux package which was also rebuilt with @world update...
2016-03-26 05:03:49	chry	So, I guess, rebuilt libselinux requires rebuild of a selinux-base-policy...
2016-03-26 05:04:08	@angry_vincent	ok, so after libselinux update you had to rebuild selinux-base-policy
2016-03-26 05:04:11	@angry_vincent	yhi make sense

2016-03-26 09:45:08	darlinger	while systemd works well, it feels restrictive

2016-03-26 10:59:09	greyeax	is there any guide for setting up audio?
2016-03-26 10:59:29	greyeax	like pulseaudio
2016-03-26 11:04:16	@funfool	most linux guides should be useful, is nothing really different with gentoo/funtoo
2016-03-26 11:04:49	@funfool	but gentoo pulseaudio may be real good search terms
2016-03-26 11:05:48	@funfool	Have you started alsamixer as a user and see if correct card is sellected?
2016-03-26 11:06:22	greyeax	funfool: can't even start alsamixer
2016-03-26 11:06:34	@funfool	make sure no columns have a m under them for mute
2016-03-26 11:06:37	greyeax	"cannot open mier: no such file or directory"
2016-03-26 11:07:05	@funfool	and that means is something else wrong .... what have you selected in epro?

2016-03-26 11:12:38	greyeax	yep
2016-03-26 11:12:47	greyeax	but like i said even if i was just trying to use alsa

2016-03-26 11:15:44	@funfool	curious if you have alsa-utils installed
2016-03-26 11:16:14	greyeax	definitely do
2016-03-26 11:16:28	@funfool	And pulseaudio is a wrapper that goes over alsa, you need alsa to work for pulse ... I believe
2016-03-26 11:16:39	greyeax	yeah i know
2016-03-26 11:16:44	greyeax	i'd be fine with just getting alsa working for now

2016-04-08 00:56:07	komunista	the only one coming in my interest is the "virtual/httpd-php-7.0", have I mask it to prevent php7, please?

2016-04-08 05:24:51	sandro_	I've a question ... if "boot-update" can be implemented in other distro's :D
2016-04-08 05:24:56	sandro_	Funtoo never dies :P
2016-04-08 05:24:57	@funfool	I am very good and practice doing the two step today  :P
2016-04-08 05:25:22	sandro_	two steps ? about what ?
2016-04-08 05:25:32	@funfool	sandro_, I suppose it could, it is just a version of grub2
2016-04-08 05:25:51	@funfool	dancing the cowbo two step  :D
2016-04-08 05:25:53	sandro_	i've sent a mail to drobbins ....
2016-04-08 05:26:37	@funfool	I like boot-update as it is very simple and does what it is supose to do
2016-04-08 05:26:44	sandro_	I think that boot-update may simplify very well the troubles with multi boot
2016-04-08 05:27:04	@funfool	But for dual boot I prefer a bigger bloated grub2
2016-04-08 05:27:39	@funfool	grub2 with osprober makes multi boot dead simple
2016-04-08 05:28:04	@funfool	boot-update you have to do some manual intervention

2016-04-08 06:25:24	reisio	mingdao: you bothered by the output, or are you actually unable to run something you want to run?

2016-04-08 06:27:38	mingdao	it goes from that prompt, to black, to that prompt, to black
2016-04-08 06:27:41	mingdao	yes, but I can't tell why
2016-04-08 06:28:45	reisio	you're using the xdm service with gdm?

2016-04-08 06:33:02	reisio	literally only took a FOOconf toggle and it fixed the issue
2016-04-08 06:33:06	reisio	sad but true
2016-04-08 06:35:32	mingdao	ok, let me check
2016-04-08 06:36:07	mingdao	this other issue is distracting me from this funTOO issue

2016-04-08 10:55:41	krushia	your `eshopts_pop: unbalanced push` is most likely a problem with /etc/portage/basrc
2016-04-08 10:55:45	krushia	or package.env
2016-04-08 10:56:06	krushia	and python error could be abi mismatch
2016-04-08 10:56:22	quiznilo	right
2016-04-08 10:56:29	quiznilo	think I need to update this neovim-python-client

2016-04-08 10:57:19	krushia	if its 2.4.1 then your unbalanced push is most definately from stale bashrc contents
2016-04-08 10:58:01	krushia	cat /etc/portage/bashrc
2016-04-08 10:58:28	krushia	is there a lot in it?

2016-04-09 09:44:50	mieko	I dont have to read an italian topic to know this
2016-04-09 09:44:52	mieko	:p
2016-04-09 09:45:15	sandro_	Only *too for me are the best :P
2016-04-09 09:45:34	mieko	happy Funtoo user on my laptop and desktop, and Gentoo on my server
2016-04-09 09:45:48	mieko	I sometimes have trouble understanding how I could live without portage
2016-04-09 09:46:04	sandro_	beh .. now there are few differencies from Gen to Fun ... :)
2016-04-09 09:46:58	sandro_	Portage for me is the most intelligent "system manager" on this Planet :P
2016-04-09 09:47:08	mieko	I started out with Funtoo before Gentoo, because a friend of mine recommended Funtoo since it was better according to him
2016-04-09 09:47:15	mieko	with the git syncs and anti-systemd stance
2016-04-09 09:47:27	sandro_	hehehe :P :P :P
2016-04-09 09:47:54	sandro_	fedora has bored me .... grrrrr
2016-04-09 09:48:06	mieko	I was never fond of RH based distros
2016-04-09 09:48:10	sandro_	is nopt affidable
2016-04-09 09:48:24	mieko	I used RHEL and CentOS for work
2016-04-09 09:48:32	mieko	can't say I enjoyed maintaining those boxes
2016-04-09 09:49:10	sandro_	instead ... with Funtoo Stable i'm very happy and also the old laptop of my father (78 years old) runs fine with Funtoo "Stable" :P :P :P

2016-04-09 09:50:11	sandro_	"a lot of troubles" .. _'_
2016-04-09 09:50:14	mieko	funtoo puts the fun back into computing ;)
2016-04-09 09:50:38	sandro_	For now ... Funtoo is my preferred OS :)
2016-04-09 09:51:05	mieko	too bad drobbins doesn't live nearby, I would've bought him a drink for making gentoo, then another one for making funtoo
2016-04-09 09:51:08	sandro_	It is "very consistent" ... :P
2016-04-09 09:51:50	sandro_	drobbins is a "Genius" for me :D
2016-04-09 09:52:33	sandro_	making easy various "technical difficulties" :P
2016-04-09 09:53:44	sandro_	FreeBSD using Ports is not at the same level ... it is more difficult to maintain a FreeBSD ; with *too using portage you can transform your installation how and when you want :P
2016-04-09 09:55:06	sandro_	Ok .... now (~ 02:00 am in my town , near Milano) ... I go to Sleep :) thanks for the discussion mieko :) :) :)

2016-04-12 02:45:46	javaJake	home: if folks here aren't able to answer, #gentoo-embedded folks deal with custom CFLAGS like that quite often. I think it depends on what you need. For a "normal" system you're going to want to stick to -O2 as I believe -Os can be considerably slower.

2016-04-12 02:55:44	javaJake	For me the biggest speed boost came from using BFS and BFQ from pf-sources kernel patchset

2016-04-12 02:59:05	home	how would I go along on changing it? Also how would I tell if switching to BFS actually worked? What benchmarks or use cases/scenarios would I look at?
2016-04-12 02:59:20	Juippis	you probably wouldnt notice any difference
2016-04-12 02:59:21	Juippis	I didnt
2016-04-12 02:59:30	Juippis	you need ck patch set for bfs
2016-04-12 02:59:39	home	For example, I play Steam games like CS:GO a lot, would I get better latency and what not?
2016-04-12 02:59:59	javaJake	There are published benchmarks. I did my own startup test and then timed a few apps launching at the same time post-startup, with a backup churning in the background. Everything ran faster for me.
2016-04-12 03:00:09	javaJake	home: no :) this doesn't affect networking
2016-04-12 03:00:15	Juippis	like, the speed boosts in official benchmarks are so minimal you wont notice any difference
2016-04-12 03:00:37	Juippis	just get SSD drive
2016-04-12 03:00:46	Juippis	its the best for speeding things up
2016-04-12 03:00:54	javaJake	Sure but ck or pf is free.
2016-04-12 03:01:31	Juippis	yea, if you usally do make menuconfig when compiling your kernel, its easy to find
2016-04-12 03:01:33	home	I just want my system even faster XD it's already blazing
2016-04-12 03:03:09	javaJake	If you use pf-sources, BFQ and BFS are default iirc so it's pretty straightforward.
2016-04-12 03:03:30	home	okay, I guess I'll look on the funtoo site on how to do it.
2016-04-12 03:04:32	Juippis	remember to save your old kernel. If things dont work out, ie you get kernel panics, just revert to the old kernel

2016-04-12 06:48:33	libben	I'm coming over from Arch, and want to maintain my everything-but-/boot-encrypted setup with dm-crypt. With Arch, you'
2016-04-12 06:49:47	libben	re supposed to run mkinitcpio to generate initramfs-linux.img, and set "hooks" for the generation in a configuration file, one of which needs to be "encrypt" to be able to load an encrypted partition at boot. What's the corresponding action in Funtoo?
2016-04-12 06:51:49	philipp__	I've never setup dm-crypt myself, so I can't give any insight, but maybe these ressources will help you: http://www.funtoo.org/Rootfs_over_encrypted_lvm and https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/DM-Crypt_LUKS
2016-04-12 06:52:43	libben	great, I opened the second link and it looks like what I'm after. Thanks!

2016-04-12 21:20:44	Tassie_Tux	angry_vincent: /usr/portage/profiles/updates/0Q-2016 has been updated. i have "sys-devel/gcc:5.3" in my package.unmask and the change will replace that line with" sys-devel/gcc:5.3.0". I do not mind this, just surprised
2016-04-12 21:21:23	@angry_vincent	right, it should replace slots
2016-04-12 21:21:46	@angry_vincent	but the mask its;ef is valid
2016-04-12 21:21:55	@angry_vincent	will keep the mask
2016-04-12 21:22:59	@angry_vincent	slotmoves doing this (changing slots in all portage entries and world file, if present there explicitly)
2016-04-12 21:26:19	Tassie_Tux	a good feature
2016-04-12 21:26:19		[21:26]
2016-04-12 21:26:38	@angry_vincent	yes
2016-04-12 21:27:46	@angry_vincent	it's like re-installing same package but without actually doing anything (compilation, etc)
2016-04-12 21:28:04	Tassie_Tux	so far I have not experienced any 'headaches' with GCC 5.3.0 :)
2016-04-12 21:28:14	Tassie_Tux	I see that there is a -r1 update
2016-04-12 21:28:22	@angry_vincent	i had none too
2016-04-12 21:28:55	@angry_vincent	-r1 have nothing in changes but needed to workaround gentoo mess with slot moves
2016-04-12 21:29:02	@angry_vincent	the ones you see in 1Q-2016
2016-04-12 21:29:32	@angry_vincent	a consequence of this is updating og 4.9.3 to any revision failing with file collisions
2016-04-12 21:29:51	@angry_vincent	had to deal with this
2016-04-12 21:29:56	Tassie_Tux	why do I suspect that those changes will cause problems :)
2016-04-12 21:30:45	@angry_vincent	main reason why it changed on gentoo side, is that SLOT can be changed with USE flag
2016-04-12 21:30:52	@angry_vincent	gcc have multislot USE
2016-04-12 21:31:21	@angry_vincent	now it's set to be always enabled via setting new SLOTS
2016-04-12 21:31:34	@angry_vincent	old ones were 4.8, 4.9, 5
2016-04-12 21:31:37	@angry_vincent	for example
2016-04-12 21:31:48	@angry_vincent	now they incremental
2016-04-12 21:32:31	@angry_vincent	:4.8.5 (for gcc-4.8.5), :4.9.3 (for gcc-4.9.3), :5.3.0 (for gcc-5.3.0)
2016-04-12 21:32:46	@angry_vincent	they still the same fro revisions
2016-04-12 21:33:56	Tassie_Tux	the gentoo gcc upgrade guide mentions revisions within same version (5.3.0, 5.3.1, 5.3.2) can cause ABI problems much like going from 4.8 to 4.9 to 5.0. could that be why gentoo has changed this SLOT situation?
2016-04-12 21:34:25	@angry_vincent	no, it's not the case
2016-04-12 21:34:34	Tassie_Tux	(i.e. slow down updates = minimise issues)
2016-04-12 21:34:43	Tassie_Tux	oh
2016-04-12 21:34:59	@angry_vincent	the case is that gentoo councils decided to not deal with packages that can change SLOT with package use
2016-04-12 21:35:16	@angry_vincent	gcc have multislot uSE
2016-04-12 21:35:32	@angry_vincent	which changing slots exactly in a way it's now
2016-04-12 21:35:42	@angry_vincent	so, now it's set automatically
2016-04-12 21:35:48	Tassie_Tux	"multislot : Allow for SLOTs to include minor version (3.3.4 instead of just 3.3)"?
2016-04-12 21:35:55	@angry_vincent	right
2016-04-12 21:36:08	@angry_vincent	but now it's enabled automatically
2016-04-12 21:36:13	@angry_vincent	with slot move trick
2016-04-12 21:36:28	@angry_vincent	and some other minor changes
2016-04-12 21:36:46	Tassie_Tux	this seems like potential 'headache' material
2016-04-12 21:36:54	Tassie_Tux	for maintainers
2016-04-12 21:37:02	@angry_vincent	what is?
2016-04-12 21:37:12	@angry_vincent	idea to change slot iwth use flags?
2016-04-12 21:37:18	@angry_vincent	i do not support this
2016-04-12 21:37:26	Tassie_Tux	yes

2016-04-13 05:43:55	mirazi_heket	can someone explain me like im five: what is purpose of USE flags?
2016-04-13 05:43:59	mirazi_heket	new funtoo user here
2016-04-13 05:46:46	mystica555	USE flags allow individual packages to be customized to meet your needs and goals; if you need for example (a bad example at that) AAC support in your movie player, but not your audio player (because you own a lot of MP3s and FLACs) you could say USE='-aac' when building the music player.  USE='aac' when building the video player.
2016-04-13 05:48:43	mystica555	mirazi_heket: in short, it allows fine-grained customization per-package, or as a group of packages, or as a whole system, for the features you want to have on your system
2016-04-13 05:49:30	mystica555	if you went with a binary based distribution, you would have to accept the distributor's choices "yes include FLAC because its free, no we cannot include MP3 because its patent encumbered, so it cant be shipped" etc
2016-04-13 05:49:36	mirazi_heket	lets take as an example https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Openbox
2016-04-13 05:49:48	mirazi_heket	if i want to use flag NLS i need to append it to /etc/make.conf?
2016-04-13 05:50:00	mystica555	perhaps.  there are multiple places where one can include USE flags
2016-04-13 05:50:35	mystica555	/etc/portage/package.use/ provides you the ability to add the USE= statements on a per-package basis. (create a new file in this package.use dir if none already exists, start adding lines to it such as:

2016-04-13 05:50:56	mirazi_heket	ok, next question, after modification of use flags i need to use emerge -auDN @world?
2016-04-13 05:50:58	mystica555	x11-wm/openbox  imlib nls -startup-notification -static-libs
2016-04-13 05:51:07	mirazi_heket	mystica555: id rather add use flags globally
2016-04-13 05:51:07		[05:51]
2016-04-13 05:51:16	mystica555	in many cases this is also fine
2016-04-13 05:51:36	mystica555	but in some cases, you might want finer control
2016-04-13 05:52:00	mystica555	a big example of this is if you add a flag that causes a large recompile for the rest of your presently-installed set of packages
2016-04-13 05:52:19	mirazi_heket	mystica555: thats intented, at least for now
2016-04-13 05:52:41	mystica555	if you only needed for example, Opus decoding support in ffmpeg, but do not need opus in anything else, it may be more beneficial to add a single line to tell ffmpeg to use it ; otherwise a lot of other audio editing programs may also be rebuilt
2016-04-13 05:53:09	mystica555	and then you sometimes get conflicts: some packages cannot be installed with certain flags when others are as well
2016-04-13 05:53:21	mystica555	USE=doc is known to break a number of packages on installing them due to recursive dependencies..
2016-04-13 05:53:46	mirazi_heket	you said /etc/portage/package.use/ could you give more... precise example? as with openbox for example?
2016-04-13 05:53:55	mystica555	 'cant install docbook(USE=doc) because docbook needs to be installed first for this program docbook needs for itself to be able to compile'
2016-04-13 05:54:13	mirazi_heket	mystica555: as for now i put there only processor instruction set (sandy bridge)
2016-04-13 05:54:22	-	rh1 (~rh1@funtoo/core/rh1) has joined #funtoo
2016-04-13 05:54:23	mystica555	mirazi_heket: you create a file of any name in this directory; a common format is ##-name.use (## being 00-99 and executed in numerical / alphabetical order)
2016-04-13 05:54:46		ptolemarch (~ptolemarc@50.252.93.91) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2016-04-13 05:54:48	mystica555	so you could create /etc/portage/package.use/01-mriazi.use
2016-04-13 05:54:52	mystica555	and it could contain the single line
2016-04-13 05:54:53	mirazi_heket	/etc/portage/00-openbox.use
2016-04-13 05:55:00	mystica555	x11-wm/openbox  imlib nls -startup-notification -static-libs
2016-04-13 05:55:06	mystica555	or it could contain any number of lines
2016-04-13 05:55:17	mystica555	i tend to keep all my edits in 1 file, 01-mikeh.use
2016-04-13 05:55:33	mystica555	but you might find it easier to manage if you have a single file-per-package; or a file-per-related-packages
2016-04-13 05:55:52	mirazi_heket	could you copy its content and put on some paste?
2016-04-13 05:55:57	mirazi_heket	at least part
2016-04-13 05:56:12	mystica555	sure, hangon 1s.
2016-04-13 05:57:16	mystica555	http://pastie.org/10795510 is my current mike.use file
2016-04-13 05:57:49	mystica555	the file itself is 3 lines with 1 line of whitespace at the top which i manually added to separate the 'command' from the 'file'
2016-04-13 05:58:22	mystica555	and, the hexchat line was a half-thought edit where i intended to use one thing, but it required mono, so i juist removed the thing used and not the whole line
2016-04-13 05:58:34	mirazi_heket	so in summary, you have only 1 file like that?
2016-04-13 05:58:35	mystica555	that effectively is only 2 useful lines : media-sound/pulseaudio and dev-qt/qtgui
2016-04-13 05:58:44	mystica555	i have only 1 file that 'overrides' the global USE flags
2016-04-13 05:58:52	mystica555	so far
2016-04-13 05:59:36	mirazi_heket	is it possible to check flags via emerge? how about already installed packages?
2016-04-13 05:59:52	fhede__	mirazi_heket you could always check what programs you need and useflags at https://gpo.zugaina.org/
2016-04-13 06:00:00	mystica555	yes! emerge is a bit slow for this however, and most gentoo/funtoo/related users use 'eix'
2016-04-13 06:00:29	mystica555	so you may have to install 'eix' first, but it is much quicker at searching the current portage database and telling what you have, and what is available
2016-04-13 06:02:03	mirazi_heket	got it
2016-04-13 06:03:24	mirazi_heket	ummm, is it enough if i want to install mate associated packages to add it via epro mixins?
2016-04-13 06:04:04	mystica555	you'll likely get a commonly used subset of 'all packages related to mate'
2016-04-13 06:04:15	mystica555	but there are likely other packages that need manual installation to complete the full Mate environment
2016-04-13 06:04:27	mystica555	I don't use mate, so i'm not sure..
2016-04-13 06:04:52	mirazi_heket	well lets say anything else, that was example
2016-04-13 06:05:06	mirazi_heket	like mixin no-systemd

2016-04-13 06:06:19		[06:06]
2016-04-13 06:06:36	mystica555	to be frank, im not 100% sure what the mixins specifically enable or disable; i just go with a kde and desktop
2016-04-13 06:06:49	mystica555	and then still have to install a few more pacakges, often via brute force of enumerating ebuilds in the kde dirs
2016-04-13 06:07:06	mystica555	mixin no-systemd would put in place the changes required to use openrc instead of systemd
2016-04-13 06:08:10	mirazi_heket	yeah. thats the objective, im trying to find wiki page with use flags per package
2016-04-13 06:08:42	mystica555	"eix" without any extra options would show you ever package, and all the possible flags
2016-04-13 06:08:49	mirazi_heket	http://www.funtoo.org/Emerge ?
2016-04-13 06:08:57	mystica555	a program that might help you at this stage however, is 'ufed'
2016-04-13 06:08:57	mirazi_heket	yup checked that :)
2016-04-13 06:09:17	mystica555	this would enumerate all possible USE flags and their descriptions
2016-04-13 06:09:19	mirazi_heket	checking ufed
2016-04-13 06:09:27	mystica555	and then allow you to modify the USE+ settings with the text ui
2016-04-13 06:10:15	mystica555	my method often however comes from "emerge something -va" and the --verbose output (-v) allows it to show me every package it would merge, and the flags.. and i scan it to see if theres anything i might want that isn't enabled
2016-04-13 06:10:38	mystica555	if i see nothing i want to change, i simply hit enter to continue. otherwise i hit N to stop and modify make.conf / package.use
2016-04-13 06:11:09	mystica555	--ask (-a) is nice in that you don't have to redo the command ,and re-wait for a lot of dependencies to calculate, if only you want to be certain before starting that you get what you expect
2016-04-13 06:11:39	mystica555	(--pretend (-p) gives you the same sort of output that --ask does, but then immediately quits without asking if you want to continue or not; its a presumed "n" to the ask question for lack of other way to describe it)
2016-04-13 06:12:35	mirazi_heket	sounds nice
2016-04-13 06:13:01	mirazi_heket	do you have procesor instrunction flags in USE in /etc/make.conf? such as mmx etc?
2016-04-13 06:13:41	mirazi_heket	processor instructions*
2016-04-13 06:13:48	mystica555	yes, all the ones that are relevant to my cpu (ivy bridge)
2016-04-13 06:14:46	mystica555	I also set CFLAGS march=ivybridge
2016-04-13 06:14:56	mystica555	(mtune is redundant with march)
2016-04-13 06:15:07	mystica555	(only if you set march to something less specific, can mtune tune it to be more specific)

2016-04-14 21:26:03	YKaelig	hi. I don't want to use the make.conf for my subarch customisation because I can't manage it with epro. I made a custom folder into ../profiles/funtoo/.../subarch/custom. But my profile could be erased after an update of epro subarch ?
2016-04-14 21:26:35	@angry_vincent	why you can't manage it with epro

2016-04-14 21:29:27	@angry_vincent	YKaelig: what's your problem with subarch?
2016-04-14 21:31:06	YKaelig	angry_vincent: I want to use a diffrent -O option. If I make this change into make.conf, epro list don't show me my customisation but only the subarch into funtoo/1.0/.../subarch option. I want ot be able to set my custom option with epro
2016-04-14 21:31:29	@angry_vincent	you need no epro for that
2016-04-14 21:31:53	@angry_vincent	use make.conf for any custom Ox optimization
2016-04-14 21:31:59	@angry_vincent	it's always served for that
2016-04-14 21:32:10	mirazi_heket	or /etc/portage/package.use
2016-04-14 21:32:35	mirazi_heket	though better as vincent said
2016-04-14 21:32:48	@angry_vincent	what subarch sets is just some predefined sane optimization flags which can be owerwritten in user's make.conf
2016-04-14 21:35:25	YKaelig	angry_vincent: ok, i understand but epro list show me always the default subarch amd64-k10 which is defined with -O2 option. I would like to see my change using epro show. Don't know if you see what I'm saying
2016-04-14 21:35:56	@angry_vincent	epro will always show what's set in subarch
2016-04-14 21:36:40	YKaelig	right ans i don't want to cat make.conf to remember which change I made.

2016-04-14 22:01:07	palo__	YKaelig: I think you can override the default in the make.conf if you want, but you don't have to investigate your cpu flags anymore, because epro chooses proper configuration.
2016-04-14 22:01:38	palo__	but I'm no expert. Don't know how this all plays together.

2016-04-14 22:04:58	YKaelig	palo__: yep, but changing to -O3 into my make.conf has nothing to do with the default subarch amd64-k10 when I  show the epro show output
2016-04-14 22:06:05	YKaelig	the make.default is clear it's -O2 not -O3

2016-04-14 22:08:41	mirazi_heket	is there a way to force package rebuild after modification of /etc/portage/package.use?
2016-04-14 22:09:23	voidzero	drobbins, I was just reading http://www.funtoo.org/Metro - all the way at the bottom, under 'distributed repositories', the header reads '/root/.metro', but that should be '/root/.buildbot'

2016-04-14 22:09:27	voidzero	mirazi_heket, just rebuild the package?
2016-04-14 22:09:58	voidzero	if you have buildpkg in FEATURES (/etc/make.conf) it should be a simple matter of 'emerge foobar'
2016-04-14 22:10:12	voidzero	if you want to build the pkg without installing, 'emerge -B foobar'
2016-04-14 22:10:18	mirazi_heket	thanks :)

2016-04-14 22:20:41	palo__	YKaelig: I had similar problems the other day. But now I don't know it anymore.
2016-04-14 22:22:15	voidzero	drobbins, also, on the metro page, the syntax to ezbuild.sh seems to have changed and the site still contains the older syntax.

2016-04-14 22:24:09	YKaelig	palo__: i think in my opinion epro show should reflect the change I made on my CFLAGS, thus epro show should ouptput something like subarch: amd64-k10 "with custom -O3"  and not just amd64-k10 which is by default -O2.

2016-04-14 22:25:39	palo__	YKaelig: epro shows the configuration it will set, but when you override it, you see it when you compile something and put the verbose option on.
2016-04-14 22:28:28	YKaelig	palo__: right, but that mean what epro show, output is useless because that not reflect my change
2016-04-14 22:30:01	YKaelig	output subarch*
2016-04-14 22:31:01	YKaelig	anyway, portageq is another good way to get my CFLAGS, thx angry_vincent
2016-04-14 22:31:01		[22:31]
2016-04-14 22:31:09	palo__	YKaelig: well epro configures what comes "before" make.conf, you know you can change every use-flag for every package different. for example you can change to compile ghc with "-j9999" so the only way to find out which use-flags are used is to use emerge and the verbose option
2016-04-14 22:31:48	YKaelig	you right
2016-04-14 22:31:51	 *	palo__ did not know portageq
2016-04-14 22:33:34	YKaelig	it seems to me that some ebuild force use of -O2 when -O3 can be a problem
