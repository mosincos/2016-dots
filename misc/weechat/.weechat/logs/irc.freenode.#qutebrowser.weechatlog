2016-02-25 11:44:07	Ferus	yes, a userscript for that exists
2016-02-25 11:45:49	fs0ciety	where can i find user submitted userscripts? :)
2016-02-25 11:46:31	Ferus	fs0ciety: I can't find it on github. I feel like The-Compiler has linked it here before so I'd suggest asking him where he's hiding it :)
2016-02-25 11:47:51	fs0ciety	thanks :)
2016-02-25 11:50:31	Ferus	fs0ciety: i found it https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/pull/873/files
2016-02-25 11:50:46	Ferus	<3 weechat relay servers + regex buffer searching
2016-02-25 11:52:09	Ferus	this script is much better than the one i wrote to use pass...

2016-02-25 20:13:29	The-Compiler	there's a qutebrowser package in Fedora very soon btw, I think they still need testers?

2016-02-25 20:23:31	mearon	may I ask... are there any plans on moving to QtWebEngine in the foreseeable future?
2016-02-25 20:25:57	wasamasa	see ticket 666

2016-02-25 20:34:27	mearon	The-Compiler: yeah I thought so...
2016-02-25 20:34:32	The-Compiler	mearon: and I'll probably end up not supporting QtWebEngine with Qt < 5.6 or maybe even 5.7
2016-02-25 20:34:41	The-Compiler	because there's just too much missing
2016-02-25 20:34:56	mearon	btw I just read this: https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/
2016-02-25 20:34:58	The-Compiler	(note both 5.6 and 5.7 aren't out yet :D)
2016-02-25 20:35:05	The-Compiler	yeah :-/
2016-02-25 20:36:07	mearon	so I looking for some (minimal) browser backend by QtWebEngine. qutebrowsing might be the first one of this kind.. :)
2016-02-25 20:36:20	mearon	thank you for the infos.
2016-02-25 20:36:34	The-Compiler	currently I'm still busy with getting everything tested - if you write Python, help with that would be very much appreciated!
2016-02-25 20:36:36	mearon	I wish I could contribute somehow, but I'm clearly not qualified.
2016-02-25 20:37:00	mearon	sorry :/
2016-02-25 20:37:04	The-Compiler	there's https://github.com/kovidgoyal/vise fwiw but I don't think it's intended for the general public
2016-02-25 20:37:45	The-Compiler	do you know HTML/CSS/JS? There's also some help I need with that regarding tests because I don't very well
2016-02-25 20:38:57	mearon	HTML/CSS basics yes, but JS not (yet)... kinda noob :)

2016-04-14 07:07:25	wasamasa	does that count?
2016-04-14 07:08:10	fs0ciety	haha.. not really - but amusing none the less.. i just notice download speeds when downloading a file are considerably slower than other browsers. Not sure why - is there option to modify the way it retrieves files - for example aria2c

2016-04-14 15:33:59	fs0ciety	was wondering what is the correct way to change the user agent

2016-04-14 15:34:08	fs0ciety	i've noticed a few times now saying i have an outdated version of safari
2016-04-14 15:34:55	The-Compiler	fs0ciety: :set network user-agent
2016-04-14 15:35:01	The-Compiler	fs0ciety: however, other things (like GitHub) will break
2016-04-14 15:36:09	fs0ciety	The-Compiler, ahh thats a shame. So if i wanted it to pretend to be Firefox would would I enter under useragent in settings
2016-04-14 15:36:16	fs0ciety	Mozilla/5.0 for example
2016-04-14 15:36:46	The-Compiler	there's a completion for them (though I recommend setting it to Chromium if anything, with Firefox far more things will break)
2016-04-14 15:36:51	The-Compiler	also... wait for it...
2016-04-14 15:36:54	The-Compiler	fs0ciety: QtWebEngine will solve all of your problems. This is a semi-automated message because I got tired of typing this by hand every time. See http://igg.me/at/qutebrowser
2016-04-14 15:37:04	fs0ciety	haha
2016-04-14 15:37:17	fs0ciety	The-Compiler, I saw something about you crowdfunding a new backend
2016-04-14 15:37:26	fs0ciety	could you like me to the crowdfund page.. and i'll help out
2016-04-14 15:37:38	The-Compiler	fs0ciety: the link is right there in that message
2016-04-14 15:37:46	fs0ciety	ahhh, sorry.. tired. haha
2016-04-14 15:37:55	The-Compiler	no worries, and thanks!
2016-04-14 15:38:13	fs0ciety	hey qutebrowser has come along way since its inception, its now my primary browser :)
2016-04-14 15:38:34	fs0ciety	wow - nice work with the goal btw :)
2016-04-14 15:39:08	The-Compiler	as for the download issues you mentioned: I never noticed it, but with QtWebKit I had to implement downloads myself entirely (not the lowlevel HTTP stuff, but other than that), and with QtWebEngine Qt/Chromium will handle them
2016-04-14 15:39:39	The-Compiler	so it's entirely possible I did something in a not-so-optimal way (or the Qt network stack did, which is kind of bad sometimes too), and it'll be better with QtWebEngine as well
2016-04-14 15:39:50	fs0ciety	The-Compiler, oh it just flucuates up and down in speed really quickly constantly
2016-04-14 15:39:56	fs0ciety	its an odd issue
2016-04-14 15:40:00	The-Compiler	And yeah! Hoping for €6000 for two months now :)
2016-04-14 15:40:16	fs0ciety	living in Switzerland, says it all for standard of living
2016-04-14 15:40:20	The-Compiler	I wonder, does it actually fluctuate or is it just the speed which is shown?
2016-04-14 15:40:37	fs0ciety	Australia, being my little racist continent - also has a really high standard of living
2016-04-14 15:40:40	The-Compiler	yeah, I can't complain about Switzerland, other than it being expensive
2016-04-14 15:40:41	fs0ciety	The-Compiler, that I am not sure
2016-04-14 15:40:56	The-Compiler	could you check with something like nload (assuming you're on Linux)?
2016-04-14 15:40:59	fs0ciety	The-Compiler, I could do a network speed test while downloading
2016-04-14 15:41:06	fs0ciety	yeah sure. i'll check right now
2016-04-14 15:42:38	fs0ciety	i'll make a little video for you so you can see
2016-04-14 15:42:47	fs0ciety	with the nload output as well
2016-04-14 15:46:55	fs0ciety	uploading small video now
2016-04-14 15:47:33	fs0ciety	it is a small 3mb file :)

2016-04-15 23:23:30	niels__	is there a way to prevent this ?
2016-04-15 23:24:23	niels__	if instead I ctrl click, the new tab is opened in the background
2016-04-15 23:24:31	The-Compiler	what does v do?

2016-04-15 23:26:10	niels__	v in tinytiny rss is a shortcut for "open in new window"

2016-04-15 23:27:45	niels__	ok i will try to open an issue.
2016-04-15 23:27:59	The-Compiler	v alone? Or Ctrl-v?
2016-04-15 23:28:18	The-Compiler	because v does nothing in my ttrss

2016-04-15 23:28:59	niels__	v alone, Ctrl-v doesn't do anything
2016-04-15 23:29:09	The-Compiler	there are hints (F for a new tab)

2016-04-18 18:03:38	The-Compiler	I personally prefer dark/planet but I guess I'll do a poll with the ~30 people who want a t-shirt
2016-04-18 18:04:15	Noctua	dark is a given

2016-04-18 18:04:20	Noctua	I'm not a flashy person
2016-04-18 18:04:28	Noctua	although the blue's not really flashy
2016-04-18 18:05:01	Noctua	Is there anything on the back? I suppose not
2016-04-18 18:05:22	The-Compiler	nope, that'd be too expensive
2016-04-18 18:05:43	Noctua	Probably
2016-04-18 18:06:10	Noctua	I'm not sure if you're taking requests, but how about the logo with transparent letters?
2016-04-18 18:06:54	Noctua	I assume the circle has transparent letters, and I think it'd look better. The whole planet filled in might give a big plastic circle look
2016-04-18 18:07:01	Noctua	I'm not a designer though
2016-04-18 18:07:48	The-Compiler	You mean the planet with transparent letters on e.g. a black t-shirt? That'd look odd I think

2016-04-18 18:23:49	Noctua	Depending on the type of print, I might prefer this.
2016-04-18 18:24:02	Noctua	Some prints kind of look like a plastic layer is placed on top

2016-04-18 18:24:23	Noctua	in that case, one big logo circle wouldn't look nice

2016-04-18 18:25:02	The-Compiler	Noctua: It'd probably be silkscreen and not that heat-transfer-stuff, so it should be quite flexible
2016-04-18 18:25:17	Noctua	Hm silkscreen would be nice

2016-04-18 18:26:30	The-Compiler	if I go for the shop I have in mind (probably won't do it myself with 3 colors and 50 shirts)
2016-04-18 18:26:34	Noctua	it would?
2016-04-18 18:26:42	Noctua	oh, because there's less color?
2016-04-18 18:26:55	The-Compiler	yeah, 2 instead of 3 colors

2016-04-18 18:29:10	The-Compiler	plus 10€ per color one-time fee
2016-04-18 18:29:32	Noctua	sounds not bad
2016-04-18 18:29:33	The-Compiler	(plus the shirts, this is only the print)
2016-04-18 18:29:46	Noctua	I should check the company I had shirts printed with recently
2016-04-18 18:29:53	Noctua	I think the price was similar though
2016-04-18 18:29:59	Noctua	if not a bit pricier
2016-04-18 18:30:07	The-Compiler	but it's crazy how many shirts you can chose from there: http://www.textil-grosshandel.eu/herren-t_shirts/
2016-04-18 18:30:18	Noctua	ha ha
2016-04-18 18:30:28	Noctua	we provided the t-shirts ourselves :P
2016-04-18 18:30:45	The-Compiler	I think http://www.textil-grosshandel.eu/bella-flowy-off-the-shoulder-t-shirt.html is perfect! :P
2016-04-18 18:30:48	Noctua	just bought them in a shop so we could fit them, and then delivered them to the printer
2016-04-18 18:30:56	Noctua	lol
2016-04-18 18:31:13	Noctua	could use one of those with my bulky shoulders
2016-04-18 18:31:13		[18:31]
2016-04-18 18:31:42	The-Compiler	the cool thing there is people could select another shirts if they want to (e.g. my girlfriend probably wants a girl-cut one, not sure if there are other female t-shirt backers)

2016-04-18 18:32:08	Noctua	that's handy
2016-04-18 18:32:29	The-Compiler	or I could get myself a qutebrowser hoodie too
2016-04-18 18:32:36	The-Compiler	and the print doesn't cost more then I think
2016-04-18 18:32:56	wasamasa	my only experience with that kind of thing is limited to spreadshirt
2016-04-18 18:33:44	wasamasa	which does pretty well in the quality department, shirts are rather pricey though

2016-04-19 19:04:45	The-Compiler	OsakaFoo: there are no code audits - note that a big part of the security-related stuff is handled by the backend though (QtWebKit and soon QtWebEngine), so the better question would be how those handle security
2016-04-19 19:05:34	-	c0c0 (~coco@145.94.44.57) has joined #qutebrowser
2016-04-19 19:05:47	The-Compiler	OsakaFoo: as for QtWebKit, the situation is rather bad, which is why I'm working on getting qutebrowser to run with QtWebEngine (see http://igg.me/at/qutebrowser :P). For QtWebEngine, that's again a rather thin layer over Chromium, which I'd say has quite good (if not exceptional) security practises
2016-04-19 19:06:27	OsakaFoo	ooh 
2016-04-19 19:06:27		[19:06]
2016-04-19 19:06:36	OsakaFoo	that's pretty cool 
2016-04-19 19:06:57	The-Compiler	OsakaFoo: for qutebrowser itself, a lot of issues you'd have with a lower-level languages (C/C++, i.e. manual memory managing, use-after-free, out-of-bounds reads, etc.) simply aren't there in Python. And I'm trying to be a good citizen by writing tests where possible and doing static analysis of the code I write with every push with various linters
2016-04-19 19:07:47	The-Compiler	as for NoScript: Not yet unfortunately, but per-domain settings are the next thing I'll look after QtWebEngine support, which will also include noscript-like functionality
2016-04-19 19:09:26	irc-5225225	Would per-domain settings allow for stylish-like stylesheets? On the website, they're defined using regex on the URL.
2016-04-19 19:10:24	The-Compiler	irc-5225225: it'd certainly make it a lot easier to implement full stylish support, and until that's done you could simply set ui->user-stylesheet per domain
2016-04-19 19:11:40	irc-5225225	Oh, there would be support for stylish themes natively, without having to view CSS? Awesome.
2016-04-19 19:14:57	The-Compiler	well, there are some people who requested it, so I'll look into it at some point - but after the current big things are finished, i.e. in a few months probably
2016-04-19 19:16:56	OsakaFoo	The-Compiler: thank you for the explination, looks like you have it all planned out and are set to make a good browser

2016-04-22 00:57:31	caveman	dunno

2016-04-22 00:58:04	The-Compiler	okay, go on and fork Chromium then, good luck ;)
2016-04-22 00:58:20	caveman	is it harder than making a new browser with qtwebengine?
2016-04-22 00:58:52	caveman	i feel it must be easy
2016-04-22 00:59:24	caveman	like 1) ask in dev mailing lists of chromium. 2) keep changing code to shrink those hefty tabs. 3) configure shortcuts. boom: shiny. 
2016-04-22 00:59:56	caveman	but i wonder if fixing the ui will ensure plugin compatibility.. how much of firefox's ui needs to be kept in order to gaurantee plugin compatibility?

2016-04-22 20:08:32	asgl-niceone	Hi, I just installed qutebrowser and on the cheat sheet it says ; gives the hint options. What is a hint?
2016-04-22 20:09:03	HolySmoke	the little labels that pop up when you activate keyboard interactive navigation
2016-04-22 20:09:04	The-Compiler	asgl-niceone: little labels for every link to select them via keyboard, try 'f'
2016-04-22 20:11:02	asgl-niceone	Wow, that's brilliant.
2016-04-22 20:11:05	asgl-niceone	Thanks
2016-04-22 20:11:28	asgl-niceone	Maybe that should be included in the :help page
2016-04-22 20:12:02	The-Compiler	hmm, maybe :help :hint could talk a bit more about what hinting is, but I guess that's hard to find too
2016-04-22 20:12:26	The-Compiler	I plan to switch to a better documentation system (asciidoc -> Sphinx) in the future and then I'll also come up with a little user manual thing, but it's not a priority right now
2016-04-22 20:16:03	asgl-niceone	I've not used a browser like this before so I was wondering how to easily navigate webpages. This makes perfect sense and is very easy to learn, but not that easy to find how to do. 
2016-04-22 20:16:03		[20:16]
2016-04-22 20:18:33	asgl-niceone	Thank you for your help. 
2016-04-22 20:18:37	asgl-niceone	Does a short tutorial like vimtutor exist for the browser?

2016-04-22 20:30:44	lamarpavel	But I might be mistaken
2016-04-22 20:36:00		[20:30]
2016-04-22 20:38:10	asgl-niceone	That's a shame. Since I am new it might be good for me to see what a new user wants to know and write it down to form a design. If I get some time next week I will see what I can do.

2016-04-23 02:23:26	demure	There is a bug with youtube-dl (at least on debian sid), there you have to use the  --no-check-certificate flag

2016-04-23 02:26:38	caveman	welll... i already have network support enabled

2016-04-23 02:31:11	caveman	hmm well now i am sure, ffmpeg is all installed
2016-04-23 02:32:28	caveman	now i am sure about the opposite. yeah you are right.. it's not with openssl
2016-04-23 02:33:49	caveman	yep that seems it. no openssl
2016-04-23 02:33:54	caveman	let me install and see :p
2016-04-23 02:35:08	caveman	;x will allow me choose a url, then once i choose it by hinting, qutebrowser spawns mpv https://the.url.that/i/have/selected/by/hinting.php right?
2016-04-23 02:35:14	The-Compiler	correct
2016-04-23 02:35:39	caveman	what bout just 'x'? x. will qutebrowser send the url of the current page that i am viewing to mpv?
2016-04-23 02:36:01	The-Compiler	exactly
2016-04-23 02:36:30	caveman	so if i press 'x' in a youtube video, it will send the URL of the youtube video page, not the URL of the video itself right?
2016-04-23 02:36:45	The-Compiler	yeah, but mpv will handle that if configured correctly
2016-04-23 02:37:00	caveman	and it's mpv's job to download that url, parse it and spot the actual video url, and then stream from it?
2016-04-23 02:37:08	The-Compiler	yeah (via youtube-dl)
2016-04-23 02:37:43	caveman	moment of truth.. all compiled with openssl.. testing
2016-04-23 02:38:03	caveman	wow.. beauty
2016-04-23 02:38:17	caveman	AND IT IS BETTER THAN HTML 5
2016-04-23 02:38:29	caveman	but no fancy youtube things like annotations...
2016-04-23 02:38:55	lancebeet	videos do seem to look nicer in mpv than they do with either flash or html5 player for some reason
2016-04-23 02:40:39	caveman	and this is more secure right.. but what about private videos that require me to log in....
2016-04-23 02:40:48	caveman	that will bring trouble eye?
2016-04-23 02:41:02	lancebeet	caveman: yes, but youtube-dl can download it through your account somehow i believe
2016-04-23 02:41:45	caveman	              machine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password
2016-04-23 02:43:05	caveman	not an elegant solution..
2016-04-23 02:43:36	caveman	qutebrowser needs to get that fancy url along with cookies (if needed) and send those to mpv
2016-04-23 02:43:50	caveman	but the web is a dirty place. i guess i need to give up elegance
2016-04-23 02:44:27	The-Compiler	not sure why it'd be less elegant for youtube-dl to have its own cookies
2016-04-23 02:44:52	caveman	cause what if i change my cookies in qutebrowser. i need to synchronize that with youtube-dl.
2016-04-23 02:45:37	The-Compiler	How would you change your cookies? I imagine you have a cookie telling youtube you're logged in, and youtube-dl has one too, end of story

2016-04-23 03:23:10	caveman	The-Compiler: can qutebrowser change proxy settings? like use socks, then use something else, all by binded commands
2016-04-23 03:24:28	The-Compiler	caveman: sure
2016-04-23 03:26:25	caveman	The-Compiler: youtube-dl can it too?
2016-04-23 03:27:25	norii	caveman: http://qutebrowser.org/FAQ.html
2016-04-23 03:27:33	norii	see question 9
2016-04-23 03:28:48	caveman	norii: you mean like pass proxy options as args to mpv?\
2016-04-23 03:29:08	norii	i think you would just replace mpv with youtube-dl in your case
2016-04-23 03:30:35	norii	looks like you could even use aria2c + youtube-dl maybe

2016-04-23 03:34:04	fs0ciety	i must say randomly that the password-fill userscript has made qutebrowser a wonderful experience for me
2016-04-23 03:34:56	norii	fs0ciety: is it able to use pass like dwb could?
2016-04-23 03:35:24	fs0ciety	how did dwb do it
2016-04-23 03:35:42	fs0ciety	all i do is make sure each entry has the password, a url wildcard and the username.
2016-04-23 03:35:48	fs0ciety	so for example 
2016-04-23 03:36:09	fs0ciety	"password"
2016-04-23 03:36:19	fs0ciety	URL: https://*.archlinux.org/*
2016-04-23 03:36:25	fs0ciety	Username: z1lt0id
2016-04-23 03:36:37	norii	in dwb there was a formfiller hook you could use i think. i cant remember how i did it but it was great having passwords autog-gen'd from dwb and land in pass
2016-04-23 03:36:37	fs0ciety	as an example and yeah set a binding to the script and it works wonderfully
2016-04-23 03:36:55	fs0ciety	it doesn't autogen new ones for you
2016-04-23 03:37:01	fs0ciety	put it will put them in as far as i know
2016-04-23 03:37:08	norii	ok perfect then i should be able set that back up
2016-04-23 03:38:16	fs0ciety	its a nice little integration
2016-04-23 03:38:50	norii	dwb wouldnt generate the pw, to be clear, it was just the external formfiller bit that would call out and then the pw would be created by pass, iirc
2016-04-23 03:39:49	norii	yeaf def
2016-04-23 03:40:25	fs0ciety	i find qutebrowser light years in front of dwb.. crashing is minimal for me.. love it
2016-04-23 03:41:51	tosmarcel	challenge: spot the Mr. Robot fan
2016-04-23 03:41:52	norii	yeah i had to stop using dwb over a year ago
2016-04-23 03:42:16	norii	tosmarcel: oooh ohh ohh i spy with my little eye
2016-04-23 03:42:22	norii	fs0ciety!
2016-04-23 03:42:22	fs0ciety	tosmarcel, haha yeah
2016-04-23 03:42:44	fs0ciety	my friends pointed out to me that i look like him as well.. so i roll with it
2016-04-23 03:42:58	tosmarcel	can't wait for season 2
2016-04-23 03:43:02	The-Compiler	I stopped using dwb as soon as qutebrowser was usable :P
2016-04-23 03:43:13	fs0ciety	same, they've hired infosec guys for the writing team
2016-04-23 03:43:39	fs0ciety	seems a lot of defcon regs got in contact with the writer and wanted to help out
2016-04-23 03:43:47	fs0ciety	so this will be very interesting

2016-04-23 03:46:16	demure	fs0ciety: do you happen to have a link to info on the 'password-fill' user script?
2016-04-23 03:46:59	fs0ciety	its on the git repo. i'll get it for you

2016-04-23 04:16:38	norii	does quteb support tags in bookmarks? it ostensibly does by fact i can add a 'tag' or keyword at the end of a bookmarks title in bookmarks file
2016-04-23 04:16:52	norii	but id like to add a keyword during the bookmark-add command
2016-04-23 04:17:21	norii	btw, quteb happily consumed by vimb bookmarks file - woot
2016-04-23 04:18:05	norii	so for instance :bookmark-add $tagname
2016-04-23 04:19:16	norii	i actually never used or thought i needed this until i started using vimb but grew to like it
2016-04-23 04:19:45	norii	but to which i am trying to say, idk if i really need it
2016-04-23 04:21:28	norii	in anycase, in vimb you could then open up a bookmark using its tag with :open !tag, and tab through if there were multiple sites with the same tag

2016-04-26 07:37:27	The-Compiler	Noctua: yeah, I also have a sticker sample from them - seems good but a little thin
2016-04-26 07:38:18	Noctua	ah perhaps
2016-04-26 07:38:29	Noctua	haven't tried their stickers, yet

2016-04-26 07:41:50	craftyguy	wow that's quite a bill for $50 t-shirts (the amount in your update)!
2016-04-26 07:42:01	craftyguy	oops, meant "50" not "$50"
2016-04-26 07:43:08	The-Compiler	welcome to Switzerland, I guess
2016-04-26 07:43:17	The-Compiler	but that German shop is more like 5€ per shirt
2016-04-26 07:43:40	craftyguy	That's not bad, but I guess it depends on how many shirts
2016-04-26 07:44:05	craftyguy	not sure if I told you already, but I'm good if you just send me a couple of stickers. I don't need any more shirts :P

2016-04-26 07:45:03	The-Compiler	I'll probably do 50 shirts, I need ~30 and the print is basically the same for 30 and 50
2016-04-26 07:45:22	The-Compiler	craftyguy: yep, already in my notes :)
2016-04-26 07:45:44	craftyguy	ah, sorry :P I should probably start taking notes too!

2016-04-26 07:51:13	The-Compiler	I can assure you it's more of a mess here than it seems like too :P
2016-04-26 07:51:48	The-Compiler	at some point I should get it all in a nice spreadsheet with stickers/shirt/talk/etc. column, but at that point people can't change their addresses on indiegogo anymore
