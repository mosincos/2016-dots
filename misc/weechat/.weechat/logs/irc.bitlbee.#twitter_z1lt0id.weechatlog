2016-03-02 11:53:20	dosnostalgic	[11:51:27] [11] So... Young Conker. Errr.... What the fuck happened?
2016-03-02 11:53:20	dosnostalgic	[12] Conker should swear, vomit, then pull out a bazooka out of his pants & shoot some shit. Not jump on your couch.
2016-03-02 11:53:20	dosnostalgic	[13] What's the point of trying to make Conker into a friendly mascot exactly?
2016-03-02 11:54:15	dosnostalgic	[14] Also, not a surprise to any of you who've been following me, I find the idea of procedurally generated levels in action games boring.
2016-03-02 11:55:32	ben_304	[15->14] @dosnostalgic There's nothing like a level in which you can feel the hand of the designer. Latest @romero Doom level was a prime example.
2016-03-02 11:55:58	dosnostalgic	[16] It still boggles my mind a little that Conker is more explicit on a Nintendo console, rather than a Microsoft one.

2016-03-02 14:54:46	JustinMcElroy	[1b] The idea: #GetPumpedForTrump, and spend 8 months REALLY convincing yourself it’d be sweet.  Like, rad and sweet. It’s gonna take 8 months.

2016-03-02 14:57:38	JustinMcElroy	[1e] If Trump loses, well, I mean, that’ll be even radder, because he sucks and would have been Bad At President. #GetPumpedForTrump is foolproof

2016-03-04 02:26:54	dosnostalgic	[42] People do remember that Ghostbusters 2 was mostly crap, right? It's tough to attempt to recapture the spirit of Ghostbusters.
2016-03-04 02:27:51	dosnostalgic	[43] And if Ghostbusters reboot is inevitable, I'd rather see a whole new cast and a New story than a bunch of old motherfuckers running around.
2016-03-04 02:29:04	dosnostalgic	[44] But what I'm seeing now isn't giving me any hope. Oh well. Maybe I'm just too old for this shit.

2016-03-04 17:11:32	Swery65	人の感情をすべて言葉で表すなんて不可能に近い。それくらい人間は複雑だ。だから僕たちには、空気を読んだり相手の気持ちを思いやるという能力が備わっている。その力を使わずに、「もっと、わかりやすく言ってくれ！」なんて言う奴は、相手を思い遣る心の欠落した人間なんじゃないかと感じてしまう。

2016-03-09 11:02:28	dosnostalgic	[59->57] @ben_304 Well, whose fault is that?
2016-03-09 11:03:02	ben_304	[5a->59] @dosnostalgic I deeply regret it, too! :D
2016-03-09 11:03:55	ben_304	[5b->59] @dosnostalgic (seriously, porting would be so much easier)
2016-03-09 11:05:59	ben_304	[5c] Something I like about getting a composition to work is that it feels like solving a puzzle. Identify the problems. Check your resources.
2016-03-09 11:07:26	ben_304	[5d] Use the resources you have (contrast, layout, etc) to fix the problems (lack of readability, blandness, etc) and you've solved the puzzle.

2016-03-09 11:08:00	ben_304	[5f] It's a bit more binary (not much, but a bit) than actual rendering, which is infinite and impossible to ever get "right", just "less worse".

2016-03-09 11:08:45	ben_304	[61] Not saying there's not an infinite level of "better composition", but when I make a fix, it feels like a real breakthrough.
2016-03-09 11:09:19	ben_304	[62] And often I can FEEL that fix work instantly, even from just blocking out with a huge chunky brush stroke that suddenly solves a problem.

2016-03-09 21:26:04	danthat	[20:48:05] [00] Oh no, I've gone off the deep end looking for the emojis button, I've strayed into Dark Twitter [turd] [icecream] [turd]
2016-03-09 21:26:04	IndieGameNews1	[20:48:38] [01] @ben_304 Essentially a bit like Technobabylon but without a structured sequence of chapters.
2016-03-09 21:26:04	danthat	[20:48:41] [02->00] They're not done with bbcode either.
2016-03-09 21:26:04	ben_304	[20:48:45] [03] @IndieGameNews1 I think that really depends on the specific narrative. Some stories work in any order, some are more reliant on linearity.
2016-03-09 21:26:04	IndieGameNews1	[20:49:47] [04->03] @ben_304 I guess the chapters would have to be more to do with creating atmosphere than story structure for it to work, but be consistent.
2016-03-09 21:26:04	ben_304	[20:50:30] [05->04] @IndieGameNews1 True, or if they were separate pieces of a puzzle that were all equally important, that might also work.

2016-03-09 21:26:04	IndieGameNews1	[20:51:27] I guess the big conclusion would really be the whole story in a way.
2016-03-09 21:26:04	IndieGameNews1	[20:51:44] [08->05] @ben_304 Was thinking of each chapter brings the characters together for the final scene.

2016-03-11 18:49:38	RohanIrvine	[a9] A scientific classification is based on an observable fact. #uxhk

2016-03-11 18:51:26	RohanIrvine	[ab] Folk classification—rich, complex, weird. #uxhk

2016-03-11 18:59:45	RohanIrvine	[b2] Boundaries overlap—things can be a member of many categories #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:02:11	RohanIrvine	[b3] Folk categorisation doesn't have a right and wrong answer #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:02:35	RohanIrvine	[b4] It's easier to describe what fits in a category than the boundaries of a category #uxhk

2016-03-11 19:21:00	RohanIrvine	[c9] Strategy 4: Talk theory—specifically Psychological theory #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:22:16	RohanIrvine	[ca] Hungry for popcorn was flashed up at a movie theatre, the advertiser claimed it increased sales at intermission by 58% #uxhk

2016-03-11 19:25:38	RohanIrvine	[cf] If you understand how people do things and why you're going to be a better Designer. #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:26:38	RohanIrvine	[d0] To wrap up—Talk stories, Talk business, Talk data, Talk psychology. Learn about these 4 things and you will be a much better Designer #uxhk

2016-03-11 19:34:47	RohanIrvine	[db] Annette's first manager was amazing—"Allowed us to explore, facilitated our discovers." #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:34:54	RohanIrvine	[dc] He understood what it took to grow a team, future individual, cultivate culture. #uxhk

2016-03-11 19:38:24	RohanIrvine	[df] Every Friday the team would go offsite for lunch. #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:39:54	RohanIrvine	[e0] Every day 3pm the team would assemble for tea and informal conversations. Annette says so many problems were solved during tea #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:41:04	RohanIrvine	[e1] Was lucky enough to experience a bad hire where someone didn't fit with the team and the manager fired them. #uxhk
2016-03-11 19:41:35	RohanIrvine	[e2] The best managers protect you as an employee, protect you as a team. #uxhk

2016-03-11 19:44:18	RohanIrvine	[e7] 3. What are the goals? Specific measurements. #uxhk

2016-03-15 11:34:59	elliotcoleman	[22] Sleeping bag + Netflix sounds great
2016-03-15 11:35:36	LudwigK	[23] They view players as the main ‘actors’ in the game, which opens the door for thought-provoking, real issues even in a game about time travel
2016-03-15 11:37:53	LudwigK	[24] Papers, Please cited as an example of this, along with Spec Ops The Line - big difference in scope there
2016-03-15 11:38:44	LudwigK	[25] Important not to lose track of the real-world issues, but they also didn’t want Life is Strange to ‘force’ a specific slant. Hmm.

2016-03-15 11:41:40	LudwigK	[27] The directors intended to treat moral choices with respect by building toward then - the friendship between Chloe and Max had to flourish …
2016-03-15 11:44:07	LudwigK	[28] … before a major choice could affect it. Episode 4 spoilers after this.
2016-03-15 11:45:32	LudwigK	[29] The team interviewed medical workers and families with handicapped individuals to portray the ‘terrible choice’ for Chloe.
2016-03-15 11:46:27	LudwigK	[2a] Lot of branching dialogue created to explore the relationships and repercussions with Chloe’s parents.
2016-03-15 11:47:17	LudwigK	[2b] ‘It was really important for us and the players to have enough time to process’ the decision. Slow editing shots with no talking, no music
2016-03-15 11:48:03	brendanl79	[2c] RT @Robert_Mills: LPD got 2 more suicidal person calls since that 15-yo was found. Resharing an old post in the hope it helps someone. https://t.co/EGzxEMfMHn <bit.ly/1pkkQuE>
2016-03-15 11:49:13	LudwigK	[2d] There’s a loooong pause before the button prompts come up. You can also say you don’t know - ‘but sometimes there’s no easy way out.‘

2016-03-15 11:50:55	LudwigK	[30] Smart: @DONTNOD_Ent removed game notifications for this choice so players could be alone with it. Gears of War 2 famously bungled this.
2016-03-15 11:52:22	LudwigK	[31] Depending on your choice, you can also talk about what you did in an alternate timeline - with Chloe. Not exactly small-talk, is it?

2016-03-15 11:54:17	LudwigK	[33] For Kate’s storyline, the @LifeIsStrange team did similar research, looking into bullying and how that might be glimpsed in the game early
2016-03-15 11:57:43	LudwigK	[34] A big part of @LifeIsStrange’s approach to these topics is integrating the situation early - not a plot tool pulled out of the drama drawer
2016-03-15 11:59:14	LudwigK	[35] They also struggled with difficulty on Kate’s emotional scene. Didn’t want to frustrate players, but she shouldn’t seem easy to manipulate.
2016-03-15 12:00:20	LudwigK	[36] Kate’s scene is really emblematic of the problems you have when turning a topic like suicide into an interactive scene.
2016-03-15 12:02:07	LudwigK	[37] On the one hand, it’s grossly simplifying it - but appearing in a game isn’t necessarily making it weightless by default.
2016-03-15 12:06:25	LudwigK	[38] In an extremely stripped-down way, Life is Strange does turn Kate into a number-check for success. But that’s what artifice has to hide WELL

2016-03-16 07:19:30	ChevyRay	[06:51:53] [03] i will never stop hating the culture of celebrating and congratulating “hard work and dedication”.
2016-03-16 07:19:30	ChevyRay	[06:52:46] [04] because the de-facto flipside to that culture is blaming and shaming people who do not, and cannot, “work hard and be dedicated"
2016-03-16 07:19:30	MildredJams	[06:53:10] [05] The quietest sound ever recorded is the sound of a Canadian saying "excuse me" in a crowd
2016-03-16 07:19:30	ChevyRay	[06:53:57] [06] (that blame is not always directed at others, more often than not it is directed at one’s self)
2016-03-16 07:19:30	ChevyRay	[06:58:55] [07] anyway, sorry GDC always makes me feel awful and depressed. on the bright side i’m looking at Dark Souls concept art and it is AMAZING

2016-03-16 10:42:53	LudwigK	[43] Mushroom 11 inverts how you have to think about moving through a level - reshaping and splitting yourself to advance. Highly recommended.

2016-03-16 10:49:11	LudwigK	[46] No power ups or changes to how the blob functions in Mushroom 11 - only the environment creates new mechanics.
2016-03-16 10:49:56	LudwigK	[47] I also liked how the game was about conservation and shiftin weight more than jumping from platform to platform (there is no jump at all).
2016-03-16 10:53:00	LudwigK	[48] Mushroom 11 is particularly interesting in that the physical shape of the environment is king - you can’t really walk if the shape bars you.
2016-03-16 10:53:40	LudwigK	[49] So, reading the shapes in the environment is part of the puzzle solution, since you can’t just jump over shit.
2016-03-16 10:55:44	LudwigK	[4a] Physics and momentum conspire to create fun visual movement - but interesting puzzles too. Unravel and other Limbo-likes toyed with this.

2016-03-16 10:56:34	LudwigK	[4d] Adhesion - sticky walls and spinning objects - are another little environmental tweak that open up all kinds of puzzles.
2016-03-16 10:57:46	LudwigK	[4e] Mushroom 11′s fireballs are a hazard, but considered a slap on the wrist since they erase parts of the blob - just like you do to advance.

2016-03-16 11:02:36	LudwigK	[50] Tablet version of Mushroom 11 is still on the way. @itayke suggests difficulty curve could be better, some hard puzzles too densely packed.

2016-03-16 11:43:45	LudwigK	[10:56:31] [00] Adhesion - sticky walls and spinning objects - are another little environmental tweak that open up all kinds of puzzles.
2016-03-16 11:43:45	LudwigK	[10:57:46] [01] Mushroom 11′s fireballs are a hazard, but considered a slap on the wrist since they erase parts of the blob - just like you do to advance.
2016-03-16 11:43:45	LudwigK	[11:02:36] [02] Tablet version of Mushroom 11 is still on the way. @itayke suggests difficulty curve could be better, some hard puzzles too densely packed.
2016-03-16 11:43:45	JustinMcElroy	[11:02:41] [03] I'm more enthusiastic than this about The Division, but here's a good lay of the land! <https://t.co/3C1xUwbclt> [@Polygon: Here's our review for @TheDivisionGame, Ubisoft's ambitious shooter *slash* MMO https://t.co/JcwsIByjs5 <polygon.com/2016/3/15/1122…> https://t.co/HztQYepBFb <pic.twitter.com/HztQYepBFb>]

2016-03-16 11:43:45	LudwigK	[11:03:48] [06] One of the really difficult puzzles led to a lot of rage quitting (the data proves it) and had ‘lingering defeat’ - too long to recover.
2016-03-16 11:43:45	Wxcafe	[11:05:06] [07] aaaah le chat patoune le plaid avec un dessin de chat :o
2016-03-16 11:43:45	LudwigK	[11:06:12] [08] Hardship in Mushroom 11 can be because it’s so minimalist - it doesn’t serenade you for winning, there’s just more gameplay (a la Witness)

2016-03-16 11:43:45	LudwigK	[11:07:24] [0a] Tablet/mobile version of Mushroom 11: Touch of Destruction will be more concise and may feature multi-touch puzzles.

2016-03-16 14:59:32	ben_304	[53->52] @dosnostalgic I liked it a lot. Like a cross between Hotline Miami and Toribash. But if you don't care about challenge mode it's v. short.

2016-03-16 15:00:46	dosnostalgic	[58->55] @ben_304 I wouldn't mind a Hotline Miami thing as an fps. I think it's a good idea.
2016-03-16 15:01:32	ben_304	[59->58] @dosnostalgic Yeah, same. And the slow motion thing doesn't really make it less intense, because there ends up being a lot going on.
2016-03-16 15:02:24	ben_304	[5a->58] @dosnostalgic I kinda thought I'd be disappointed in it, but when I got to the end I still thought it was cool and worth playing. Surprising
2016-03-16 15:04:02	ben_304	[5b->58] @dosnostalgic And honestly the most refreshing thing about it wasn't so much the unique mechanics as much as indie FPS that's not proc. gen.
2016-03-16 15:04:18	ben_304	[5c->58] @dosnostalgic Actually having designed levels counts as a nice change these days.
2016-03-16 15:04:37	dosnostalgic	[5d->5c] @ben_304 Yeah, that's definitely a big plus.
2016-03-16 15:05:26	ben_304	[5e->5d] @dosnostalgic idk, I'm really torn on recommending it because it's a pretty hefty price for a 2 hour game. But I felt it was worth it.
2016-03-16 15:05:57	ben_304	[5f->5d] @dosnostalgic And I've been seeing @kittyhorrorshow playing the extra content and it sounds awesome, so I gotta try that.
2016-03-16 15:06:33	dosnostalgic	[60->5e] @ben_304 I'll keep that in mind. Although I'd need to get a new machine before I could play it, so by the time I get to it, it's gonna be <$
2016-03-16 15:07:50	ben_304	[61->60] @dosnostalgic Oh yeah, if you're gonna get it on sale or whatever then 100% recommend just to see what it does.
2016-03-16 15:08:06	ben_304	[62->60] @dosnostalgic I thought you were considering buying it now.

2016-03-26 10:12:01	dosnostalgic	[96->94] ... But then your statue would have a big seam in it.
2016-03-26 10:12:01	dosnostalgic	- That's okay.  It'd have one anyway.
2016-03-26 10:12:26	ben_304	[97->93] @GrundislavGames I remember you playing it, yeah. Considering you like Gobliiins I think you'll like them. They've gotten very musical too.
2016-03-26 10:12:47	dosnostalgic	[98->92] @ben_304 I loved the first puzzle about hunting and feeding people
2016-03-26 10:13:02	ben_304	[99->93] @GrundislavGames Particularly Botanicula and Samorost 3 sometimes feel like playing a DJ's sampler pad with amazing music.
2016-03-26 10:13:03	Swery65	[9a] I love "Showa" style cafe called "Kissa-ten". #japanesepic https://t.co/GyQUeWaOMm <instagram.com/p/BDZN6hFgU2S/>
2016-03-26 10:13:19	ben_304	[9b->98] @dosnostalgic Yes, that's one of my favourites. Very creative and beautifully animated.
2016-03-26 10:13:30	dosnostalgic	[9c->95] @ben_304 I love Amanita, but I think I prefer when their games are on the easier side. Botanicula pretty much nailed it.
2016-03-26 10:14:37	ben_304	[9d->9c] @dosnostalgic Botanicula is my favourite of theirs. I feel like Samorost 3 is kinda between that and Machinarium.
2016-03-26 10:15:01	ben_304	[9e->9c] @dosnostalgic Machinarium is their most popular game, but probably my least favourite. The puzzles were a bit more annoying in that.
2016-03-26 10:16:19	dosnostalgic	[9f->9d] @ben_304 Botanicula is sooo cute, but I love the little Samorost guy & his dog and that world more. I paid $10 for Samorost 2.
2016-03-26 10:16:24	GrundislavGames	[a0->99] @ben_304 Yeah I'm a fan of that gameplay mechanic. Doot! :D
2016-03-26 10:17:17	dosnostalgic	[a1->9e] @ben_304 That's my opinion as well. I like the game, but many of the puzzles were frustrating.
2016-03-26 10:17:21	ben_304	[a2->9f] @dosnostalgic Yep, I know what you mean. His little dancing animations brought a smile to my face a bunch of times in this haha.
2016-03-26 10:17:43	ben_304	[a3->a0] @GrundislavGames Exactly like that, yeah.
2016-03-26 10:18:41	ben_304	[a4->a1] @dosnostalgic Yeah, I agree. This got close to that, but never quite pushed me over that edge of actually being frustrated, which was nice.

2016-03-29 13:09:35	dosnostalgic	[14->12] @WadjetEyeGames That's actually common for HL2. It's field of view is set to 75 by default, which is way too low.

2016-03-29 13:14:34	dosnostalgic	[1d->1a] @WadjetEyeGames FOV is stuck at 75 until you put on your suit in the game, unfortunately.
2016-03-29 13:15:04	dosnostalgic	[1e->1a] @WadjetEyeGames There's also a weird drift from controls. It's hard to explain, but yeah, motion sickness with HL2 is very common.
2016-03-29 13:15:52	dosnostalgic	[1f->1a] @WadjetEyeGames It's possible to reduce it though. For me turning off vsync and bringing fov to 90 works just fine.

2016-04-09 10:53:59	ben_304	[d7] Indicating combat bonuses before battle helps me stay informed about tactics rather than relying on me remembering the minutiae myself.

2016-04-09 10:55:36	ben_304	[d9] Things like "armies" of units and naval support make tactical decisions more varied and approachable.
2016-04-09 10:56:11	ben_304	[da] It's nice when an impenetrable city can become vulnerable if you can position your units on the right terrain and give them naval support.
2016-04-09 10:57:19	ben_304	[db] This has the added bonus of making a strong navy more empowering than I remember it ever being in other Civ games (except Alpha Centauri).

2016-04-09 18:57:06	danthat	[05] If you're going to #Rezzed (or any industry event) here are my two TOP TIPS. Ready?
2016-04-09 18:58:19	danthat	[06->05] 1. Always re-introduce yourself when you see someone you've met before. Everyone meets hundreds of people at these things...
2016-04-09 18:58:45	danthat	[07->06] ... and there's nothing more embarrassing than someone saying "Hi Dan!", starting up a conversation and assuming I'll remember who they are.
2016-04-09 19:01:10	danthat	[08->07] 2. Handshake everyone, but wash hands thoroughly with soap and scalding water every opportunity you get, or you'll get like 5 colds at once.
2016-04-09 19:01:46	danthat	[09->08] In summary, then: "other people are awful, and dirty."

2016-04-19 15:32:01	ChevyRay	[6a] i notice a lot of indies doing pixel art games have animations that look REALLY stiff (eg. limbs just flopping for character walk, etc.)
2016-04-19 15:32:34	ChevyRay	[6b] here’s a simple tip: when animating, erase the entire body and draw each frame as a silhouette separately. then color in afterwards
2016-04-19 15:32:58	ChevyRay	[6c] if you focus on the animation & composition, you can worry about getting the limbs & clothing in place afterwards
2016-04-19 15:33:59	ChevyRay	[6d] i know you probably spent lots of time getting the standing posture right, but re-drawing it will be way faster ‘cuz you already did it once

2016-04-20 12:56:48	dosnostalgic	[12:55:16] [02] I'm so incredibly fortunate to grow up with an open gaming platform. In retrospect. I can legitimately say that there were games completely
2016-04-20 12:56:48	dosnostalgic	[03->02] devoid of any sort of KILLING or fast trigger ACTION and everyone loved them. And at the same time you had some of the most violent games of
2016-04-20 12:56:59	dosnostalgic	[04->03] the time selling tons of units as well. And there was no competition. I liked both. Others picked whatever they liked.
2016-04-20 12:58:18	dosnostalgic	[05] My two favorite genres are adventure games and first person shooters because of that. Complete opposites. It's fun to play both.

2016-04-20 13:05:12	VinceTwelve	[09] So apparently there's a type of caterpillar in Okinawa that can do this if you come into contact with its hairs... https://t.co/Aa9RmBAs0u <pic.twitter.com/Aa9RmBAs0u>
2016-04-20 13:10:11	JustinMcElroy	[0a] Syd and I used graph paper and math  to solve Are You the One S2, and I'm SO IRRITATED that the cast hasn't put it together yet.
2016-04-20 13:10:21	VinceTwelve	[0b] I had no idea why a quarter of my body suddenly became covered in itchy hives but the doctor instantly knew it was from a caterpillar.

2016-04-20 13:22:44	VinceTwelve	[11->0f] @ben_304 I heard that if you make eye contact with an Australian snake, they have to call your loved ones to identify what's left of you.
2016-04-20 13:23:23	ben_304	[12->11] @VinceTwelve I've heard they think Myst 4 is the best game in the series!
