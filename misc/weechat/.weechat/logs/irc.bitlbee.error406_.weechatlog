2016-03-03 11:20:22	fsociety	haha all good
2016-03-03 11:20:34	fsociety	yeah for some unknown reason it wouldnt package with binaries as if it couldnt find them
2016-03-03 11:20:34	error406_	how u doin? have fun getting ue4 workin?
2016-03-03 11:20:37	fsociety	got no idea why
2016-03-03 11:20:44	error406_	weird!
2016-03-03 11:20:55	fsociety	but i got it to run, cooked the whole thing which took ages and ran it
2016-03-03 11:21:24	fsociety	ill probably go on the ue4 irc chan and see what they say. i know its something to do with the git build and there is probably a work around
2016-03-03 11:21:29	error406_	weird it took a long time, doesn't take very long to do that step on pc...
2016-03-03 11:21:47	fsociety	oh its because the first time round the linux ue4 editor has to convert all the shaders
2016-03-03 11:21:52	fsociety	cause of opengl
2016-03-03 11:21:55	error406_	might not utilise the graphgics card in the same way or somthing... that's all I can think of
2016-03-03 11:22:05	error406_	ohh... yeah that makes sense
2016-03-03 11:22:23	fsociety	but it ran smooth as butter on 2k with only one 970
2016-03-03 11:22:50	fsociety	tonight i'll install ue4 on windows and see if cross-compiling on linux is easier
2016-03-03 11:22:55	fsociety	actually can you look for me now if possible
2016-03-03 11:23:02	fsociety	since you are probably using it right now
2016-03-03 11:27:47	error406_	well I have a package for linux button here if that's what you mean heheh
2016-03-03 11:29:22	fsociety	press it

2016-03-03 11:39:25	fsociety	i looked into ue4 a bit more i see the paper2d plugin is what you use for 2d stuff :)
