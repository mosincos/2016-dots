2016-04-06 12:17:19	krarkrrrc	should i be editing the root version?
2016-04-06 12:17:32	raphael1	nope, yo usohuld be using your /home/.xinitrc
2016-04-06 12:17:39	DigitalKiwi	can we respond with a triple negative so you're as confused by our answer as we are your question?

2016-04-06 12:19:31	raphael1	I think this will solve the problem. My theory is since you didn't background the xrdb -merge job, it starts again and undoes itself when you reload i3 manually
2016-04-06 12:19:43	raphael1	Nah, just add the &s

2016-04-06 15:12:50	|aaron	Anyway, kglobalaccel until very recently *also* did not die when receiving SIGTERM due to trying to catch the signal and not doing it properly, thus getting stuck. Because catching signals properly isn't trivial and really not necessary, I've removed that part.

2016-04-06 15:21:25	|aaron	ah right that makes sense
2016-04-06 15:21:42	|aaron	everything i read suggests opening up a different TTY while its shutting down and checking which processes are still open
2016-04-06 15:21:55	|aaron	but i just g et a blank screen when i switch TTYs at this point

2016-04-06 15:30:32	sheep	the message during shutdown (or stopping jobs) needs to be more verbose though and say what jobs are waiting to stop
2016-04-06 15:31:01	honestly	sheep: it always says the user scope is hanging which is completely useless.
2016-04-06 15:31:26	sheep	technically it is the user session hanging.  it's a separate process not part of the master process
2016-04-06 15:31:38	sheep	but it should have its own output for the user units waiting too

2016-04-06 15:32:35	honestly	systemctl stop vthe user scope' works flawlessly and instantaneously and then leys you shutdown without issie btw so it's probably not judt a program in the user scope hanging.

2016-04-06 15:38:43	honestly	You need to get the output of "systemctl status 'the user scope'" while it's hanging in during shutdown to see what's hypothetically hanging inside it
2016-04-06 15:38:56	honestly	I sure haven't managed to do that

2016-04-06 15:40:33	Hwkiller	sheep: it's not in the journal
2016-04-06 15:40:41	Hwkiller	I just checked
2016-04-06 15:40:43	Hwkiller	nothing.
2016-04-06 15:40:43	honestly	There is nothing of value in the user normal except that the scope was hanging
2016-04-06 15:41:05	honestly	Which you already know from looking at the screen during shutdown
2016-04-06 15:41:16	sheep	in |aaron's case it was implied that dbus.service was what had to be killed in the user journal
2016-04-06 15:41:17	honestly	User journal*
2016-04-06 15:41:28	Hwkiller	honestly: mine doesn't even have /that/
2016-04-06 15:41:32	|aaron	yeah theres literally nothing. there is a 90 second gap between my pulseaudio service being successfully stopped and tjhen "dbus.service: State 'stop-final-sigterm' timed out. Killing"
2016-04-06 15:41:39	sheep	it doesn't say "dbus.service is handing" it does what |aaron just said
2016-04-06 15:41:58	Hwkiller	my journal is void of anything hanging
2016-04-06 15:42:03	|aaron	except on the console is says "dbus stopped" on the line asbove
2016-04-06 15:42:04	Hwkiller	even though I saw the damn thing hanging
2016-04-06 15:42:05	sheep	separate /var?

2016-04-06 15:43:23	sheep	this sounds like it's absolutely deserving of a feature request in systemd 
2016-04-06 15:43:37	|aaron	god i hate systemd so much :(

2016-04-06 15:44:17	sheep	Hwkiller: FEATURE: actually show what stop jobs are currently waiting for user sessions and put a message in the logs indicating what jobs were hanging when the timeout was reached
2016-04-06 15:44:21	Hwkiller	but, to be fair, I had bootup/shutdown issues occasionally on the old rc system.
2016-04-06 15:44:33	sheep	also provide an interactive option to halt systemd's shutdown process (or startup) and inspect the state

2016-04-06 15:45:18	honestly	sheep: That sure would be helpful.
2016-04-06 15:45:23	Hwkiller	why is it hard to find the waiting process?
2016-04-06 15:45:29	sheep	because systemd still has to respond to events like main processes in services moving from the starting state to active
2016-04-06 15:45:33	fs0ciety	i did swap from systemd to openrc on arch and that usually resolved all of my systemd woes
2016-04-06 15:45:38	sheep	if you mean the second one
2016-04-06 15:45:54	|aaron	fs0ciety: yeah it sounds like thats our only solution
2016-04-06 15:46:02	fs0ciety	i had the same hanging problem as well
2016-04-06 15:46:02	sheep	just printing out what units are currently waiting for shutdown when it's waiting for stop jobs (and having the user session do the same) shouldn't be that hard
2016-04-06 15:46:10	honestly	Just log all still existing processes in the scope every ten seconds.
2016-04-06 15:46:16	honestly	Bam done.
2016-04-06 15:46:20	Hwkiller	sheep: that alone would make me happy
2016-04-06 15:46:20	sheep	that would fill up the logs a lot

2016-04-06 15:46:29	sheep	Hwkiller: file an issue on github
2016-04-06 15:46:39	Hwkiller	apparently there's already an issue on github

2016-04-06 15:46:50	|aaron	hwkiller: yeah same. could either fix it or file a bug report in the right place
2016-04-06 15:47:05	sheep	as someone who has had to write UI, knowing what it's supposed to look like really makes it a lot easier to know what information it needs to show
2016-04-06 15:47:06	honestly	sheep: Don't be ridiculous.
2016-04-06 15:47:07	|aaron	yeah i found tons of issues on github related to this

2016-04-06 15:47:56	sheep	it's not rediculous
2016-04-06 15:48:07	fs0ciety	lennart is probably like pfft.. users
2016-04-06 15:48:30	honestly	There are approximately zero processes justified to all be running 10 seconds after they were told to clean up and exit.
2016-04-06 15:48:33	sheep	the interactive debug thing would be massively hard to do
2016-04-06 15:48:42	sheep	uh

2016-04-07 17:51:09	Strout	localhost is just a subdomain and localdomain is the actual domain, e.g I have several computers in my home.

2016-04-07 17:51:59	Strout	so if I want to change the domainname should I only do it within /etc/hosts?

2016-04-08 22:37:31	cdidd	I have another question. So if there is no tracking of installed status for meta packages, what happens when a package becomes deprecated, renamed, or incorporated into another packages. In other distors, you can, install a virual package, and rely on that for chaniging package set. What happens in Arch?
2016-04-08 22:37:40	cdidd	You just get a stale package?

I have a feeling though, it has something to do with hardware settings, or something I'm missing :( Would I have better results if I try booting from the micro sd instead of the usb? or is that even possible?

I'm using lastpass, but not very happy with it, I dislike that it is closed-source and so well-known (so prone to attacks) and that they can't possibly disclose an attack because their business relies on security, so I can't count on them being straight about it.

2016-04-09 02:29:17	stochastix	For anyone who is good at regular expressions,  is it possible to match  ??12l   or  ?1;32r   at the same time?  I can do them separately but was wondering if there is a way to combine them. Or is it just better to call sed twice or more for fairly different matches?  Also, is there a way in one sed command to search for  this, or this, or this  ?
2016-04-09 02:29:20	Halfwit	xananax: It came about honestly, do understand it's meant to help, not impose.

2016-04-09 05:47:07	demonicmaniac3	amdgpu you do need to enable experimental support though

2016-04-09 05:47:43	L0g4nAd4ms	so AMDGPU will be better since its updated frequently 
2016-04-09 05:47:53	Mion	so, you will be using amdgpu no matter if you use the closed source amd driver or the free driver

2016-04-09 05:48:08	demonicmaniac3	L0g4nAd4ms: basically radeon is deadn and amdgpu is where it's at for everything gcn
2016-04-09 05:48:21	Strout	Is there a bettter Unicode font with symbols like '❯', currently on Archlinux this is rendered as Bitmap. I believe on my OSX it is rendered as SVG.

2016-04-09 05:48:28	demonicmaniac3	and amdgpu is joint development of open source and "proprietary" devs

2016-04-09 09:12:36	AiShield	NYTimes, I mean they can't validate it so why not. Only an issue really if you pay with a CC or some other payment form that requies an address
2016-04-09 09:12:47	ironkai	MacGyver: "# echo 1 > rom" is giving me permission denied, even with sudo. Any ideas?
2016-04-09 09:12:47	Accession	sheep: I would just rather request it be added (obviously if denied due to some catastrophic reason that's fine) to the package, rather than adding the patch myself, especially with something like coreutils.
2016-04-09 09:13:10	AiShield	NYTimes, I know digital ocean is pretty strict about that, IME they won't even let you use a paypal account that doesn't have a validadted CC
2016-04-09 09:13:13	sheep	Accession: if it fixes an actual issue, coreutils's devs will add it
2016-04-09 09:13:15	MacGyver	ironkai: Does your user have write permissions to the directory you're trying to write the ROM to?
2016-04-09 09:13:16	AiShield	NYTimes, Maybe just USA problems tho
2016-04-09 09:13:16	NYTimes	AiShield: so do I pay like with bitcoins ?

2016-04-09 09:13:47	sheep	Accession: it's possible that coreutils already has the change, but fedora had to take it from a newer version and patch it into an older version because they need to support an older version.  that's just a gues though
2016-04-09 09:14:04	AiShield	NYTimes, yea if you can find a VPS dealer that accepts them. I know there are a few, but don't know OF any.

2016-04-09 09:15:02	Accession	sheep: that's possible. and like you said, I just googled and found a simliar -2 patch of the same name, which apparantly has bugs according to the LFS people. So.. maybe it's just too new at the moment.

2016-04-09 09:16:59	ironkai	Anywhere to sell 2nd hand parts? :P
2016-04-09 09:17:15	Mion	ebay
2016-04-09 09:17:25	AiShield	ebay but I think you might be seeking a better answer
2016-04-09 09:17:28	Sapphirus	craigslist or your local classified
2016-04-09 09:17:40	ironkai	I live in Turkey. The second hand market isn't that great here.
2016-04-09 09:17:45	Mion	your local lug/hackerspace
2016-04-09 09:17:51	Sapphirus	ebay might be your best bet
2016-04-09 09:17:55		distortedvoice is now known as distortedvoice_
2016-04-09 09:17:58	MacGyver	AiShield: Asrock extreme6/3.1 based on the x99 chipset (not recommendable though, I'm having boot issues with it which I haven't resolved yet); Intel i7 5820k; 32GiB DDR4; AMD Radeon R9 390.
2016-04-09 09:18:05	Mion	just sell to the deash then
2016-04-09 09:18:17	MacGyver	AiShield: And a cheap-ass old radeon for the host.
2016-04-09 09:18:27	Mion	MacGyver: asrock generally are buggy as heck
2016-04-09 09:18:35	Mion	both hardware and firmware wise
2016-04-09 09:18:48	Sapphirus	there's a reason you never cheap out on the mobo unless you're really that dry on cash
2016-04-09 09:18:49	AiShield	MacGyver, I went AMD FX 8320, Gigabyte 990x, and a Sapphire 390x
2016-04-09 09:18:50	MacGyver	Mion: Once it's booted it runs like a charm though.
2016-04-09 09:18:51	Mion	they have had some "interesting" designs though
2016-04-09 09:18:54	Sapphirus	same goes with psu
2016-04-09 09:19:00	MacGyver	Sapphirus: I *didn't* cheap out on the mobo.
2016-04-09 09:19:01	Mion	like cards with support for both ddr and ddr2
2016-04-09 09:19:04	Sapphirus	asrock tho
2016-04-09 09:19:10	Sapphirus	asrock are cheap in comparison to other brands
2016-04-09 09:19:18	Mion	or two different cpu sockets
2016-04-09 09:19:19	Sapphirus	thus lower quality
2016-04-09 09:19:20	MacGyver	Sapphirus: I went for a board with official support for what I wanted, Asus didn't have that.
2016-04-09 09:19:23	Mion	Sapphirus: not by much
2016-04-09 09:19:28	AiShield	MacGyver, I tried to do it on skylake for my friend and struck out, but that was when skylake was a new and VFIO isn't the thing to do over VNC as I've learned
2016-04-09 09:19:29	Mion	in regards to the price
2016-04-09 09:19:48	Mion	in some cases they are actually more expensive
2016-04-09 09:20:16	AiShield	MacGyver, do you get the purported "near native
2016-04-09 09:20:17	ironkai	Well, it seems I can salvage $400 out of my 2600k, 560 and the motherboard.
2016-04-09 09:20:22	MacGyver	AiShield: Hmm.
2016-04-09 09:20:28	MacGyver	AiShield: Benchmarking this is hard.
2016-04-09 09:20:35	MacGyver	AiShield: I can run battlefield 4 on ultra settings.
2016-04-09 09:20:37	Sapphirus	how much would I be able to sell a i7 4790k & z97 motherboard for?

2016-04-09 09:20:56	Mion	depends on how scroupeless you are
2016-04-09 09:21:00	MacGyver	AiShield: I'd say it's near-native-enough.
2016-04-09 09:21:06	Mion	if you are a compelte asshole: 120% of new price
2016-04-09 09:21:17	Mion	if just a normal asshole: 80% of new price
2016-04-09 09:21:18	Sapphirus	I could do that since the cad is shit
2016-04-09 09:21:34	Mion	a realistic price is about 1/2 of newprice
2016-04-09 09:21:37	AiShield	MacGyver, I give it 4/8, but I have some issues with mine, missing performance and such but a lot of it is win10 hogging the cpu with system and compressed memory and other random processes
2016-04-09 09:21:39	Sapphirus	Paid less for it new at the store than what it retails for now
2016-04-09 09:21:40	Mion	at most
2016-04-09 09:21:43	MacGyver	AiShield: The problem with benchmarking it is that benchmark programs have no friggin' clue what they're dealing with.
2016-04-09 09:21:49	AiShield	MacGyver, IKR
2016-04-09 09:21:54	Sapphirus	So I could list it at the old retail price in CAD and ppl would likely buy it

2016-04-09 09:22:12	MacGyver	AiShield: Especially if you're running any kind of disk encryption.
2016-04-09 09:22:28	Mion	Sapphirus: the current price of 4xxx serie stuff is not realistic since it is discontinued really
2016-04-09 09:22:33	AiShield	MacGyver, No FDE but what other tweaks do you recommend
2016-04-09 09:22:37	ironkai	Since I'll be starting from scratch with a new machine, do you think it's worth going Skylake, since selling my ram doesn't seem as extreme now.
2016-04-09 09:22:46	Sapphirus	Mion still being sold by retailers
2016-04-09 09:22:46	MacGyver	AiShield: I mean to tune down vm.dirty_ratio/bytes and vm.dirty_background_ratio/bytes.
2016-04-09 09:22:54	Sapphirus	so i wouldn't go as far as saying that yet
2016-04-09 09:23:05	Sapphirus	I could probably get a way with $350-$360 CAD for the CPU
2016-04-09 09:23:05	Mion	Sapphirus: also some morons thinks that the 4xxx serie is somehow magic and therefor drive up the used market price of them
2016-04-09 09:23:09	Mion	Sapphirus: old stock

2016-04-09 09:27:58	AiShield	MacGyver, Ah ok
2016-04-09 09:28:22	MacGyver	AiShield: It's to do with how much data to be written to disk is cached before the write process starts.

2016-04-09 09:47:52	Mion	also if you don't print for two weeks they will be clogged :p

For example if I'm listening to music through Clementine on linux, and try to start a WINE application that uses audio it'll be mute. But if I close clementine and then restart the wine app audio will work.

Got the program to work after deleting the config file (man, I love strace...) ... but when I set the setting to use qtkeychain, I get <https://ptpb.pw/wE6b>.  Seems like it was not compiled with the relevant flag set, or a lib version mismatch?  This is too critical of a

2016-04-09 18:00:05	sheep	kinda
2016-04-09 18:00:15	sheep	it converts the calls to windows libraries

2016-04-09 18:01:11	sheep	mostly older games from the windows 95 era and a couple modern applications
2016-04-09 18:01:19	sheep	sometimes it's faster
2016-04-09 18:01:41	jushur	fishbulb: there is some extra code for Wine that can run games in Direct3D/DirectX mode. cant realy advice on anything related to Wine anymore tho. As i stoped using it several years ago.

2016-04-09 18:01:59	sheep	there is some slight overhead for having to convert data between what the Windows APIs expect and what the native APIs expect

2016-04-09 18:02:28	fishbulb	and probably lower than the windows overhead
2016-04-09 18:02:37	demonicmaniac3	at least nowadays with mt patches
2016-04-09 18:02:41	sheep	possibly higher
2016-04-09 18:02:44	demonicmaniac3	before mt times performance was quite horrific
2016-04-09 18:02:55	fishbulb	what does mt stand for?

2016-04-09 18:03:13	fishbulb	Oh. yeah there are many threads in these machines
2016-04-09 18:03:14	sheep	it also depends on what the API is.  converting Windows OpenGL stuff to GLX is trivial

2016-04-09 18:04:11	jushur	a thing to consider is the fact that running games in Wine will open you up to some possibly nasty exploit cenarios. heavily dependant on what you run in Wine.
2016-04-09 18:04:28	sheep	it depends on whether the exploit is exploitable in wine
2016-04-09 18:04:47	fishbulb	I'm not interested in games so much
2016-04-09 18:04:58	fishbulb	or at all, I'd just run those in windows
2016-04-09 18:05:00	sheep	obviously an exploit in an NT kernel service won't affect wine since it doesn't contain the NT kernel

2016-04-09 18:06:16	sheep	if the exploit is in the application itself, then it's an issue
2016-04-09 18:06:22	jushur	basicly giving the remote 100% access to anything you have in your access as current running user.
2016-04-09 18:06:33	sheep	well, wine does have some containment
2016-04-09 18:06:41	sheep	not sure how good it is though
2016-04-09 18:06:48	fishbulb	for that matter how do I see what has access right now
2016-04-09 18:06:53	demonicmaniac3	and how is that different from any other application you run as your user?
2016-04-09 18:07:15	sheep	anything running under your user account has access to the same privileges your user account has
2016-04-09 18:07:35	sheep	more or less
2016-04-09 18:07:38	demonicmaniac3	you could argue that that is a problem facing any and all proprietary applications you run as your user

2016-04-09 18:08:01	jushur	the big difference is that almost all applications for ms win has some issues, mostly due to relying on things that are tighlty tied into the system.
2016-04-09 18:08:19	fishbulb	usb access?
2016-04-09 18:08:27	demonicmaniac3	and again nt kernel font drawing does not happen in wine

2016-04-09 18:09:04	sheep	or issues in services running with supervisor privileges
2016-04-09 18:09:07	fishbulb	windows has a kernel?

2016-04-09 18:09:43	sheep	windows uses a hybrid kernel model though, so some of the stuff that runs in kernel mode isn't part of the kernel
2016-04-09 18:09:52	demonicmaniac3	and only give him access to your game directory/win software

2016-04-09 18:11:48	demonicmaniac3	so it would be a bug in a library call from within wine that can be exploited to gain root priviledges then
2016-04-09 18:12:27	demonicmaniac3	unless morons run wine as root but then they should get shot anyways
2016-04-09 18:12:48	fishbulb	the point is to safely contain the windows program I assume
2016-04-09 18:13:27	sheep	in that case your best option is to run wine on a separate account without the ability to sudo or su to root

2016-04-15 12:53:31	GodGinrai	weird question: Why didn't you just get a DS3?
2016-04-15 12:53:52	Elwyn	Well, I'm from Brazil and anything eletronic here is expensive af
2016-04-15 12:53:59	GodGinrai	ahhh
2016-04-15 12:54:04	GodGinrai	ok, that makes more sense
2016-04-15 12:54:12	Elwyn	For example this controller was $20 but a DS3 would cost me around $100
2016-04-15 12:54:22	Elwyn	I bought it at an oficial Sony store
2016-04-15 12:54:30	Elwyn	even they stopped ordering oficial DS3
2016-04-15 12:54:35	GodGinrai	lol
2016-04-15 12:54:59	GodGinrai	that's kind of depressing if even the official store is not stocking it
2016-04-15 12:55:22	Elwyn	yep
2016-04-15 12:55:41	GodGinrai	I won't run into this problem because I actually stray from using Dualshock whenever possible :P
2016-04-15 12:55:46	Elwyn	hahaha
2016-04-15 12:56:01	GodGinrai	I use the official USB Sega Saturn controller for all of my fighting games on PS3
2016-04-15 12:56:03	Elwyn	It was such a bummer to find that it was so expensive that I tought about importing a steam controller
2016-04-15 12:56:14	Elwyn	Since I would only use it for PC 
2016-04-15 12:56:16	GodGinrai	except for .hack//Versus, because that one doesn't allow dpad control.
2016-04-15 12:56:51	GodGinrai	I have a Steam controller from the early shipments
2016-04-15 12:56:53	GodGinrai	I like it
2016-04-15 12:57:17	GodGinrai	I use it on Windoze, tho'.  I haven't messed around with it on Linux
2016-04-15 12:57:37	Elwyn	I was a little skeptical about buying it because of the new design
2016-04-15 12:57:51	Elwyn	So I though it would be better to wait sometime and let ppl review it
2016-04-15 12:57:57	GodGinrai	it really depends on the kind of games you play and how controller-agnostic you are
2016-04-15 12:58:17	ediT	why not, kb & mouse
2016-04-15 12:58:28	Elwyn	ediT, depends on the game tbh
2016-04-15 12:58:33	Elwyn	for most of the game I would use kb & mouse
2016-04-15 12:58:48	ediT	eyah
2016-04-15 12:58:52	ediT	yeah*
2016-04-15 12:59:03	GodGinrai	ediT: I prefer controllers over KB&M for anything that is not FPS or RTS

2016-04-15 13:00:37	ediT	the, steam controler looks nice
2016-04-15 13:01:00	GodGinrai	I grew up playing games on consoles, so I enjoy them

2016-04-15 13:01:33	ediT	GodGinrai: what do you think about the, steam boxes
2016-04-15 13:01:45	ediT	over a xbox - ps4 etc
2016-04-15 13:01:49	GodGinrai	pid1: any HID compliant one should work.  I would think any PS3 one should work just fine.

Yes, that is pretty self explanatory.  But when I have both "linux 4.5" and "linux-headers<4.5" installed (verified by looking at "pacman -q"), how do I know what's happening?

Here's the PKGBUILD for reference https://ptpb.pw/NNim and I verified the linux version by looking at "pacman -Q".

2016-04-15 14:52:59	DigitalKiwi	Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.
2016-04-15 14:53:00	DigitalKiwi	Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.

2016-04-15 19:01:32	Carkasjak	you choose what's best for you
2016-04-15 19:01:37	osteri	when you do the installing dance 10 times a row and you're not 14 anymore, then you start looking for GUI installer
2016-04-15 19:01:53	Carkasjak	why do you need to install 10 times in a row?
2016-04-15 19:02:14	osteri	because i need to do it?
2016-04-15 19:02:33	Pupnik	for what purpose
2016-04-15 19:03:08	Carkasjak	if you're intalling it multiple times on similar systems you're better of making your own automated install script tailored to your needs
2016-04-15 19:03:17	osteri	lol, let's accuse him, instead of solving the actual problem

2016-04-15 19:04:07	Carkasjak	I just asked out of curiosity
2016-04-15 19:04:34	Carkasjak	with arch being a rolling distro there should rarely be a need to reinstall

2016-04-15 19:05:33	osteri	i just don't get why extra choices while installing is bad, of course intelligent installer would let you choose between GUI/text

2016-04-15 19:06:00	Carkasjak	GUI installers have fewer choices

2016-04-15 19:06:25	Carkasjak	also more work for the devs, yes
2016-04-15 19:06:44	osteri	Carkasjak: my point was, if you install it to 10 machines then you don't need choices
2016-04-15 19:06:45	Carkasjak	the arch way is for the devs to do as little work as possible ;p
2016-04-15 19:06:49	osteri	the dev thing is true
2016-04-15 19:07:12	Pupnik	if you are bulk installing you need a proper solution not to manually install the OS 10 times
2016-04-15 19:07:20	Pupnik	you wont have much fun installing windows manually 10 times either
2016-04-15 19:07:26	Carkasjak	indeed
2016-04-15 19:07:31	teraflops	osteri: what I like is that the default installation method is best for whatever option you require to setup
2016-04-15 19:07:37	Carkasjak	that brings us back to making your own script instead of doing a gui install 10 times
2016-04-15 19:08:21	njx	which is faster
2016-04-15 19:09:18	teraflops	Look at Debian installer. It lacks of many of these options you're talking about. That's why deboostrap is 10x better

Apparently the kernel made a switch from HDA to I2S mode. Since then: loud clicks and general fuckery. Also the DP problems only surfaced one or two kernel version ago.

2016-04-16 02:06:28	avenita	dont get me wrong i do appreciate the changes they made with GTK+, CSS nodes is something i have heard themers to ask repetedly on the past, but dunno, alwas seems that they push the changes to screw user customization

2016-04-16 02:08:15	avenita	Broken-Tissuebox, Gnome devs pushed a huge update to GTK+, which, with no surprise (as always) broke tons of gtk themes
2016-04-16 02:08:37	Broken-Tissuebox	How are the xfce4 themes?
2016-04-16 02:08:40	aw1	trying out gnome after a long time ... the window menu that is available using Alt+Space is available but the shortcut keys are not anymore ... for example Alt+Space+x used to maximize windows but now i have to move fingers to the up and down arrow keys to select menu option. Any fix for that?
2016-04-16 02:08:40	picobit	does freenode support any sort of hidden service via Tor or I2P?
2016-04-16 02:08:42	thurstylark	Still doesn't change the fact that this change has been months in the making.

2016-04-16 04:54:55	phrik	Due to changes in the new version of GTK+, many custom themes are broken. See https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2015/11/20/a-gtk-update/ for more information on the changes, and https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK%2B#Themes for a list of themes supported by GTK+ 3.20
2016-04-16 04:55:01	pid1	If you're talking about themes, see ^
2016-04-16 04:55:01	JoshDreamland	apparently greybird team didn't really budget for GNOME team pulling the rug out from under them
2016-04-16 04:55:07	JoshDreamland	so someone else will have to port greybird

2016-04-18 11:31:15	hlzr	My roommate sleeps in the room with the computer/TV.  I don't want something loud.  It is not really clear when purchasing hardware for linux which way to go.  I spent maybe 40 minutes prior to purchase trying to tease out which drivers were more stable on the low end front and turned up nothing...
2016-04-18 11:31:49	Justice	mpan: 600 series have passive about half the thermal output, better opengl support and for sure better driver support and about same price.
2016-04-18 11:31:58	hlzr	Really, it is difficult to assess the quality of a driver without actually trying it out in my experience (this covers the embedded world too...)

2016-04-18 11:32:12	Celti	hlzr: That's a Tesla architecture card, will do fine with nouveau for day-to-day usage but will *probably* have reclocking issues
2016-04-18 11:32:38	mpan	hlzr: I believe you should try with **old** proprietary ones, if you want stable operation. By old I mean some “legacy” version.
2016-04-18 11:32:40	Celti	hlzr: Video acceleration (VDPAU, etc) is fully supported on nouveau, but you need the external firmware for it (AUR/nouveau-fw package)
2016-04-18 11:33:12	mpan	hlzr: however, I would just try anything available and see which one works the best.

2016-04-18 11:33:49	Justice	Celti: didnt they even get reclocking on some cards?
2016-04-18 11:34:16	hlzr	I'll start nouveau and switch to an older proprietary...How does Nvidia handle legacy hardware?

2016-04-18 11:34:34	mpan	Celti: I assume performance is the factor here. But if no… well, just test. I’m myself using nouveau, but I see that with old hardware if stable and good operation is needed, proprietary driver seems to work better :/

So if I’m running xev, I press F2, all is fine, but I hold down Ctrl or Alt and press F2 and no events show up. Odd numbered F-keys are fine. This is really annoying because now I can’t acccess tty2 (Ctrl+Alt+F2). It was working, though kinda sluggishly, and now it’s not working at all, and my tty2 X session is inaccessible.

The polkit package contains a textual authentication agent called 'pkttyagent', which is used as a general fallback.

2016-04-19 12:05:03	thrice	nexii: sure.  GTK 3.20 indeed "broke" most themes (or, they need to get updated for the new theme style).  Your article was a work around for one of those GTK themes which broke ("breeze").  But, for GTK, the default theme will almost always work.  So, just changing that until your favorite gets updated works

2016-04-19 17:32:38	du5tball	i still don't get your point though. when upstream says it's stable, we depend on their word. so in the end, it's still upstream's problem, not arch's fault.
2016-04-19 17:32:40	cdidd	Though in Ubuntu, for main set of packages, crucial fixes are backported...

2016-04-19 17:36:39	cdidd	du5tball I want "rock solid stable" stable versions. But the reality is that OS developers don't have resources to debug the software to this level. Especially after major rewrites...
2016-04-19 17:36:45	Boohbah	interesting. good thing to have backups
2016-04-19 17:36:58	jushur	just so you know, because of the broken support i can localy exploit the login console and gain root on "any" arch install.
2016-04-19 17:37:04	du5tball	cdidd: because they're managing an operating system, not the software itself. that's what developers are for.

2016-04-19 17:40:20	cdidd	Boohbah The impression I got studying the stability of these two filesystems, is that btrfs is very much still "not ready" for sensitive missions.
2016-04-19 17:40:49	demize	Boohbah: "RAID-Z is a data/parity distribution scheme like RAID-5, but uses dynamic stripe width: every block is its own RAID stripe, regardless of blocksize, resulting in every RAID-Z write being a full-stripe write. This, when combined with the copy-on-write transactional semantics of ZFS, eliminates the write hole error."

2016-04-19 23:42:00	MrSpock	it is probably not a problem with the port, but the phone deciding not to do charging on a port that can only deliver 500ma

2016-04-19 23:42:31	TheLemonMan	if it works fine in Ubuntu it's possible that's because of their 1337 customizations heh
2016-04-19 23:42:39	MrSpock	btw, how do you know that it actually gave out the full 500mW when using wifi? did you use an actual usb doctor or similar?

2016-04-20 09:07:33	dagle	The fact that it only lets you do so little.
2016-04-20 09:08:05	grazzolini	dagle: I don't know what you are talking about. really. OpenSSH lets you do a hell lot of things

Today I was going to change that and instead SSH into a user-account and from there su. But after doing some read-up, I saw that su and sudo seem to be fundamentally flawed from a security point of view. And that it's recommended again to go directly to root. Maybe even getting rid of su and sudo completely. What's your

2016-04-21 12:57:40	BrianAllred	So /etc/resolv.conf was symlinked to /var/run/connman/resolv.conf. After I upgraded from connman 1.31-3 to 1.31-6, /var/run/connman/resolv.conf was gone, meaning my internet was borked. Luckily, journalctl -b revealed that NetworkManager was complaining about the missing resolv.conf, and I found /etc/resolv.conf.bak.

2016-04-21 23:10:08	teraflops	icedhobbler: nope
2016-04-21 23:10:18	demize	joltmode: It's because they've started mounting the filesystem without data=writeback.
2016-04-21 23:10:35	demize	But since /etc/fstab has data=writeback, the remount service tries to remount with those options.
2016-04-21 23:10:37	alad	icedhobbler: just with more broken stuff
2016-04-21 23:10:45	demize	But that fails, because you can't change the data opt on remount.

2016-04-22 01:35:04	archmonkey	virtualbox has this weird driver for host machines. it supposedly gives direct3d support. the game mostly works inside the vm because I gave it 8gb ram and maxed out a lot of settings. also it's a 15 year old game designed to work on ps2's and pc's
2016-04-22 01:35:30	archmonkey	it's part of the virtualbox additions

2016-04-22 01:37:32	BradPJ	Hi all, quick question. I've made PKGBUILD's that make base and base-devel meta packages, so that I can very easily see what I've explicitly installed. It works well and I think it is fine to do, but just in case I'm missing something, does anyone know any downsides to this?

2016-04-22 01:40:22	BradPJ	Scimmia: The same would happen if it was not a meta package though right? As once a group is installed, new members wouldn't automatically install either?
