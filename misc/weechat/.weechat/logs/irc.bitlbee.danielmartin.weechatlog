2016-04-07 17:08:39	DanielMartin	Hehehe well good. I was about to ping you to say I don't know how to chat to you anymore :p I tried the irc channel but couldn't find you
2016-04-07 17:08:54	DanielMartin	It's a compromise at least
2016-04-07 17:11:41	fsociety	im inthe channel #theden
2016-04-07 17:11:45	fsociety	:)
2016-04-07 17:12:08	fsociety	how are you finding the minix box
2016-04-07 17:12:27	fsociety	have you installed spmc yet, its the only real way to get the latest kodi
2016-04-07 17:12:38	DanielMartin	I joined that, what is your username on there?
2016-04-07 17:12:43	fsociety	anon
2016-04-07 17:13:15	DanielMartin	The box is going well - that plus torrents on the NAS seem to have solved most problems. Had to add another drive to the NAS to keep up though
2016-04-07 17:13:27	DanielMartin	Oh, I think I said hi to you one day :p
2016-04-07 17:13:52	fsociety	haha i probably wasn't there
2016-04-07 17:13:55	fsociety	or didn't check
2016-04-07 17:14:09	fsociety	ive spent the past few days rebuilding my osdrive on my mainpc
2016-04-07 17:14:37	fsociety	sorry for the lack of spaces, lag from tethering to my phone and being on the train
2016-04-07 17:16:43	DanielMartin	Hehe all good - I can figure it out :p
2016-04-07 17:16:54	DanielMartin	What happened to your OS? Or just time for a rebuild?
2016-04-07 17:17:04	fsociety	i spent the other week playing ps1, segacd and psp games on that minix box
2016-04-07 17:17:23	fsociety	oh i was compiling software between two different versions of gcc and things started to break and not build
2016-04-07 17:17:28	fsociety	so i decided it was time for a rebuild
2016-04-07 17:22:18	DanielMartin	Hehe ahh dear, the joys of tinkering
2016-04-07 17:22:18		[17:22]
2016-04-07 17:22:41	DanielMartin	I haven't pushed the Minix box past basic stuff yet - haven't had the time
2016-04-07 17:22:57	fsociety	haha yeah but secretly i love it
2016-04-07 17:28:00		[17:22]

2016-04-15 09:40:44	fsociety	phil asked me to help him with his ue4 venture
2016-04-15 09:41:57		irc: disconnected from server
2016-04-15 09:43:43	DanielMartin	Cool, it's pretty exciting stuff hey?
2016-04-15 09:43:43		[09:43]
2016-04-15 09:44:53	fsociety	indeed, anything to do that isn't cca is good
2016-04-15 09:44:55		[DanielMartin] is away: Away
2016-04-15 09:45:01	fsociety	i suggested i teach phil git
2016-04-15 09:51:00		[09:45]
2016-04-15 09:51:03	DanielMartin	CCA?
2016-04-15 09:51:09	fsociety	company i work for now

2016-04-15 09:51:31	DanielMartin	Ahh right, over working there?
2016-04-15 09:51:41	fsociety	been here nearly 10 years
2016-04-15 09:51:49	fsociety	would rather work closer to home than in blackburn for a start
2016-04-15 09:51:58	DanielMartin	Wow... Yeah I can understand that
2016-04-15 09:52:19	fsociety	and also i've had an internal hatred for my bosses brother for nearly a decade
2016-04-15 09:52:40	DanielMartin	Well hopefully his stuff takes off - it's sounds very promising... I'd love to be a part of it, just have a couple of offers to consider though
2016-04-15 09:55:19	DanielMartin	I remember you mentioning that, definitely time to get out if you can
2016-04-15 09:57:52	fsociety	i heard, phil told me
2016-04-15 09:58:13	fsociety	realistically i'll be doing a little ue4 and more so looking after his business's backend
2016-04-15 09:58:25	fsociety	seems its going to be a small business now
2016-04-15 09:58:40	fsociety	so who else is going to create a centralised git repo and central server.. haha
2016-04-15 10:04:00		[09:58]
2016-04-15 11:04:19	DanielMartin	Hehe cool, I'm sure he will very much appreciate all the tech setup and knowledge you have :)
2016-04-15 11:04:19		[11:04]
2016-04-15 11:04:48	DanielMartin	So you considering leaving your job to help full-time or just on the side for now?
2016-04-15 11:08:29	fsociety	well the next month i'll see how it goes and do it part-time
2016-04-15 11:08:38	fsociety	if after that month it looks solid, then i'll consider it
2016-04-15 11:10:29	DanielMartin	Cool, sounds like a good plan :-) so far it sounds like it's all going to take off pretty well
2016-04-15 11:13:17	fsociety	seems so
2016-04-15 11:14:41	fsociety	if anything any excuse to get my long service leave.. ;)
2016-04-15 11:20:00		[11:14]
2016-04-15 11:21:44	fsociety	nearly finished downloading quantum break

2016-04-15 11:47:00		[11:41]
2016-04-15 13:10:29	DanielMartin	Random q - do you know any open source code base that is like stackoverflow? Essentially a qa forum? Looking to set something up for my team

2016-04-18 13:33:00		[13:27]
2016-04-18 13:46:40	DanielMartin	Good question, have not had much time to plan yet... Yourself?
2016-04-18 13:50:02	fsociety	well this week is a lot of ue4 and this week i'm going to retire the water cooling i think
2016-04-18 13:50:02		[13:50]
2016-04-18 14:01:48	DanielMartin	Cool, what's parts of ue you been getting into recently?
2016-04-18 14:02:00	DanielMartin	What's going to replace the water cooling?
2016-04-18 14:05:05	fsociety	looking at the bone rigging thing for phil
2016-04-18 14:05:05		[14:05]
2016-04-18 14:05:12	fsociety	and for cooling, just standard air cooling
2016-04-18 14:05:29	fsociety	i just keep staring at it and wondering when it will fail
2016-04-18 14:11:00		[14:05]
2016-04-18 14:12:32	DanielMartin	Ahh yes, haven't looked at any rigging yet but seems like it can get complicated.. Good luck! Hehe
2016-04-18 14:13:12	DanielMartin	Yes, I can imagine the stress that uncertainty would add... Cause when it fails I'm sure it won't be pretty
2016-04-18 14:17:16	fsociety	yeah so on wednesday going to buy a decent cooler, drain the the system, remove all the tubing, etc and be done with it
2016-04-18 14:17:24	fsociety	it maybe a weekend job now i think of it
2016-04-18 14:23:00		[14:17]
2016-04-18 14:37:35	DanielMartin	Hehe these things always escalate to more time consumption than expected and you don't want to be with a PC for days
2016-04-18 14:39:48	fsociety	yeah - also i want to migrate my pc
2016-04-18 14:39:48		[14:39]
2016-04-18 14:40:09	fsociety	on saying that though - if i do work for phil - i'll need a pc.. of equal strength.. haha.. naa.. i just want to make his uncle gasp
2016-04-18 14:46:00		[14:40]
2016-04-18 15:50:43	DanielMartin	Hehehe nice :p well you know, the better the tools the better the result
2016-04-18 15:50:43		[15:50]
2016-04-18 16:26:12	fsociety	hahaha.. i'll make him bankrupt

2016-04-18 16:32:00		[16:26]
2016-04-18 17:07:27	DanielMartin	Hehehe #wishlist
2016-04-18 17:07:27		[17:07]
2016-04-18 17:07:48	DanielMartin	I've been looking into exoplatform, seems pretty cool but quite a huge tool
2016-04-18 17:13:00		[17:07]
2016-04-19 13:17:23	fsociety	afternoon sir
2016-04-19 13:17:23		[13:17]
2016-04-19 13:17:25		[DanielMartin] is away: Away
2016-04-19 13:23:00		[13:17]
2016-04-19 13:32:37	DanielMartin	Why helloo, how's your day treating you?
2016-04-19 13:33:59	fsociety	it is treating me slowly
2016-04-19 13:34:01	fsociety	how about you
2016-04-19 13:37:04	DanielMartin	It's one of those weeks... Too much to do, not enough time and not really enthused hehe
2016-04-19 13:40:28	fsociety	hahaha something like that yeah
2016-04-19 13:40:28		[13:40]
2016-04-19 13:40:38	fsociety	what you been up to?
2016-04-19 13:46:00		[13:40]
2016-04-19 14:08:17	DanielMartin	Too many things... Trying to hire 8 or so Front End devs, apps analytics people etc.. Painfully slow. Dealing with blockers and issue resolution... Platform roadmaps for AEM... API definitions for consumer contracts etc
2016-04-19 14:08:17		[14:08]
2016-04-19 14:08:24	DanielMartin	All quite dry boring stuff
2016-04-19 14:09:00	DanielMartin	What's keeping you busy?
2016-04-19 14:14:00		[14:09]
2016-04-19 14:37:26	fsociety	haha. you dont wanna hire me.. haha
2016-04-19 14:37:26		[14:37]
2016-04-19 14:44:18	DanielMartin	Hehe I think you would get bored and go stir crazy with all the bs here... But hey, if your interested in Front End web dev... There's opportunities around ;-) hehe
2016-04-19 14:44:44	DanielMartin	Somehow I don't think loose languages like JS are your thing...
2016-04-19 14:49:22	fsociety	i like nodejs
2016-04-19 14:49:43	fsociety	something about it i like, seems like a nice progression from general js
2016-04-19 14:55:00		[14:49]
2016-04-19 14:55:56	fsociety	i think my biggest passion is actually backend infastructure
2016-04-19 14:56:11	fsociety	i have this obsession with create a backend for people :)
2016-04-19 15:02:00		[14:56]
2016-04-19 19:29:48	DanielMartin	Yes, I can see how the backend infrastructure fits in better with your tastes... It's more real than the fluffy front end :p
2016-04-19 19:29:48		[19:29]
2016-04-19 19:30:25	DanielMartin	We don't do much with node at the moment, mainly just for builds... Most work these days is in Angular.js... Which is... A thing
2016-04-19 19:36:00		[19:30]
2016-04-19 21:45:55	fsociety	so is python :)
2016-04-19 21:45:55		[21:45]
2016-04-19 21:47:11		DanielMartin (1gl7915crqy3a1nesz69tx7opc@public.talk.google.com) has quit (localhost.localdomain gmail.com)
2016-04-19 21:51:47	-	DanielMartin (1gl7915crqy3a1nesz69tx7opc@public.talk.google.com) is back on server
2016-04-19 21:57:00		[21:51]
2016-04-19 22:00:35	DanielMartin	I'd say it's probably a more fun thing :p
2016-04-19 22:01:24	fsociety	Naa. At Linuxconf they used python to write all the frontend web applications that talk to the lower level stuff
2016-04-19 22:01:38	fsociety	for example dropbox do that.. all of their maintainence server stuff is written in python
2016-04-19 22:01:55	fsociety	reason being its easy for employees to submit code and its really easy to debug
2016-04-19 22:02:17	fsociety	you'd be surprised how much python is used in server demographic
2016-04-19 22:02:28	fsociety	when i spoke to the community manager of github he said the same thing
2016-04-19 22:02:54	fsociety	which reminds me i have to check to see if pycon tickets are available, its held in melbourne this year
2016-04-19 22:03:35	DanielMartin	Very interesting, never seen it being used for web apps... Will have to look for some examples etc
2016-04-19 22:03:43	fsociety	i'll send you some if you like
2016-04-19 22:03:49	fsociety	what type of examples are you looking for
2016-04-19 22:03:51	DanielMartin	Cool
2016-04-19 22:04:54	DanielMartin	Main stuff I do is CMS and simple single page stuff like checkouts and data capture
2016-04-19 22:05:15	fsociety	the code is pretty easy to read here are some little programs I wrote it in to help maintain my OS
2016-04-19 22:05:18	fsociety	https://github.com/z1lt0id/emerge_notifier
2016-04-19 22:05:27	fsociety	https://github.com/z1lt0id/funtoo_updater
2016-04-19 22:05:30	fsociety	you write your own cms?
2016-04-19 22:06:21	fsociety	an example of a python cms
2016-04-19 22:06:22	fsociety	http://quintagroup.com/cms/python/mezzanine
2016-04-19 22:06:31	DanielMartin	Nah, build and extend the Adobe one (AEM)
2016-04-19 22:06:45	DanielMartin	It's all based on Java and JCRs for the backend
2016-04-19 22:07:02	fsociety	python is extremely powerful due to the abundance of modules
2016-04-19 22:07:32	fsociety	look at this repo of python modules, and you'll get the idea
2016-04-19 22:07:34	fsociety	https://pypi.python.org/pypi
2016-04-19 22:08:06	fsociety	i'm so under-utilised at my current job.. haha
2016-04-19 22:08:22	DanielMartin	Will check it out - ive glanced at it before but never had the time to get to know it
2016-04-19 22:08:32	fsociety	i learnt python in 3 days.. haha
2016-04-19 22:08:39	fsociety	i was surprised how quickly i could pick it up
2016-04-19 22:08:42	DanielMartin	Hehe I have no doubt about that
2016-04-19 22:08:57	fsociety	not to mention there is so much documentation on it
2016-04-19 22:09:08	fsociety	though im not the type of guy who cuts and pastes from stack overflow.. shudder
2016-04-19 22:15:00		[22:09]

2016-04-22 09:34:33	fsociety	so i bought a dreamcast :)
2016-04-22 09:34:58	fsociety	and you can install a whole custom unix system on that uses the original developer libraries. so it can play all of the games now but actually be a usable kind of machine
2016-04-22 09:35:33	fsociety	someone made a mod so you can use an sd card reader also to put all the isos on considering that the dreamcast uses a propietary disc system called gd-rom which a 1gb discs

2016-04-22 10:42:43	fsociety	its the one console i love dearly
