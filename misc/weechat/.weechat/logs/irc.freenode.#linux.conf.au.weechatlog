2016-01-21 11:11:02	brong	meeting with Pobox people and learning how to sysadmin SmartOS so can help with their machines.  Yay for different unixes
2016-01-21 11:11:17	brong	DrParis: I think we considered IRCloud
2016-01-21 11:11:31	brong	not sure why slack won off the top of my head
2016-01-21 11:11:35	brong	it might be as good or even better
2016-01-21 11:11:48	brong	the underlying thing is that nobody decided to set it up
2016-01-21 11:11:58	fs0ciety	brong: Haha yeah, different unixessseses.. if I have to deal with AIX or Solaris anytime soon I'd rather run screaming.  
2016-01-21 11:12:00	brong	until someone else went and painted the bikeshed
2016-01-21 11:12:07	adhoc_	bot integrations is the only thing going for it, that swayed us
2016-01-21 11:12:13	brong	and now everybody is out with the graffiti cans
2016-01-21 11:12:33	nevyn	fs0ciety: tru64
2016-01-21 11:12:52	brong	fs0ciety: there's OpenBSD in there too
2016-01-21 11:12:53	DrParis	My biggest issue with Slack TBH is that the apps are all weird web wrappers that don’t feel fast enough
2016-01-21 11:13:07	brong	DrParis: I don't type fast on mobile anyway
2016-01-21 11:13:16	DrParis	I meant desktop, too
2016-01-21 11:13:18	nevyn	until the email to the list I'd never heard of it.
2016-01-21 11:13:24	brong	yeah, so I just use the web on desktop
2016-01-21 11:13:35	fs0ciety	brong: Hahaha.  Glad there isn't an OpenBSD machine in here in my office.  Then again I've spent the past 3 days installing Funtoo on my laptop
2016-01-21 11:13:44	DrParis	their web (and native app, which is just a wrapper) is slow and unpleasant :(
2016-01-21 11:14:04	brong	I used to like OpenBSD for routers when I last used it 16 years ago... and it's probably still good for that, which is what it's doing
2016-01-21 11:14:19	brong	DrParis: yeah, you saw my rant about the scrolling
2016-01-21 11:14:25	brong	but it's consistent
2016-01-21 11:14:26	DrParis	aye
2016-01-21 11:14:32	brong	I use the IRC gateway on my work desktop as well
2016-01-21 11:15:01	simon_green	For everyone of us who hasn't heard of Slack, there were be thousands of Slackers who haven't heard of IRC.
2016-01-21 11:15:13	brong	simon_green: not that unbalanced in this community
2016-01-21 11:15:18	adhoc_	simon_green: indeed.
2016-01-21 11:15:24	DrParis	I’m surprised that people in tech wouldn’t have heard of Slack TBH
2016-01-21 11:15:26	DrParis	But yeah
2016-01-21 11:15:37	brong	yeah, not having heard of slack, or uber, or tinder or whatever
2016-01-21 11:15:48	fs0ciety	ahh the slack conversation from the mailing list
2016-01-21 11:15:49	vmbrasseur	o_O
2016-01-21 11:15:51	simon_green	I used it at a $job once, and of course their big incident last March.
2016-01-21 11:15:52	brong	I guess if you're in a silo which doesn't interact with messaging
2016-01-21 11:15:54	DrParis	Apparently the IRC gateway is not being turned on for the Slack instance, so meh to that
2016-01-21 11:15:57	fs0ciety	that conversation escalated quickly
2016-01-21 11:15:57	adhoc_	DrParis: it has made news for al lthe wrong reasons, so i'm surprised too
2016-01-21 11:16:01	DrParis	adhoc_: right
2016-01-21 11:16:13	edunham	I'd suppose that for someone in FOSS communities, it's easier to miss noticing Slack than to be unaware of IRC
2016-01-21 11:16:47	fs0ciety	I'm a newbie to Linux Conf, not a newbie to Linux.. I'd rather just stay in irc :)
2016-01-21 11:17:06	adhoc_	edunham: it isn't FLOSS, so easy for eyes to glaze over, if you don't care about all the integrations, which is its key selling point, to part you with your money =)
2016-01-21 11:18:45	fs0ciety	adhoc_: Personally I don't think Slack is the right software to use for this purpose. But it is an "unofficial" thing - 
2016-01-21 11:19:08	edunham	my biggest complaints are the scrollback disappearing on free tier, the inaccessibility to community members who rely on screen readers, high barrier to entry (need manual invitation or someone to set up an auto-invite system) and Yet Another Login
2016-01-21 11:19:18	adhoc_	fs0ciety: i'm not saying it isn't useful (it is), but context is everything.
2016-01-21 11:19:23	edunham	but oh well, I think the right solution here is to just hang out in IRC and get help here :)
2016-01-21 11:20:11	fs0ciety	adhoc_: Oh I understand, promoting open-source is the whole point of the conference and then use Slack is like a slap in the office
2016-01-21 11:20:17	fs0ciety	edunham: I agree
2016-01-21 11:20:43	adhoc_	so how FLOSSy is irccloud ?
2016-01-21 11:20:44	edunham	oh and just for the record, I'm more than happy to mentor any newbies who're afraid of IRC clients. 
2016-01-21 11:21:29	fs0ciety	edunham: how involved can linuxconf be if it requires newbies to be mentored?

2016-01-21 11:22:27	adhoc_	fs0ciety: if you are entering a new community, there will always be new things, and things that look daunting
2016-01-21 11:22:32	edunham	fs0ciety: I don't really understand what you're asking, but I've met a variety of nice people who just needed a little "no it won't explode" type handholding at the start of learning to use a tool, and then they're ok
2016-01-21 11:22:50	adhoc_	fs0ciety: a five minute conversation can break the ice and help you get you on your feet and in the right direction =)
2016-01-21 11:23:20	edunham	sure, at some point you'll never get anywhere if you can't be self-directed -- but when something's totally new, it helpes to have someone point at the screen and name all the parts so you can Google your problems usefullly
2016-01-21 11:23:26	fs0ciety	edunham: this is the thing i'm confused about, are you talking in the aspect of a "linux newbie"
2016-01-21 11:24:15	ecognito	Well, that's been a mighty big cat set amongst the pigeons.
2016-01-21 11:24:17	edunham	I'm talking about anyone in the target audience identified for Slack -- those who for whatever reason find IRC daunting.
2016-01-21 11:24:25	fs0ciety	see i thought this whole newbie thing was are you new to the conference, not new to open source
2016-01-21 11:24:29	fs0ciety	edunham: now i see
2016-01-21 11:24:47	fs0ciety	edunham: well i guess i'm not in that demographic then :)
2016-01-21 11:25:09	edunham	I mean, this'll be my first LCA, but I'm on the "pretty please don't make me Slack" side of the holy war so I figure I'd better back up my opinions with time and energy :)
2016-01-21 11:25:45	bradm	what I don't get is people are all up in arms about Slack, but seem ok to use Twitter
2016-01-21 11:26:23	fs0ciety	bradm: people are like that. haha.

2016-01-21 11:26:39	adhoc_	bradm: for twitter, the barrier to entry is lower and it is public
2016-01-21 11:26:42	fs0ciety	personally i'm not any social network sites, i do have my own personal xmpp server though.
2016-01-21 11:26:45	*	faulteh_ expresses his smugness on gnusocial ;)
2016-01-21 11:26:49	adhoc_	bradm: thats a good point actually =)
2016-01-21 11:27:26	adhoc_	faulteh_: that still exists? link!??!
2016-01-21 11:27:37	DrParis	adhoc_: irccloud isn’t very flossy, but it provides a featureset equivalent to slack on top of irc for those who want the slack features..
2016-01-21 11:27:49	faulteh_	adhoc_: http://gnu.io/social/
2016-01-21 11:27:56	DrParis	and also provides the ease-of-entry that slack does, but to the IRC channel
2016-01-21 11:28:06	adhoc_	DrParis: i see the pricing model there now 
2016-01-21 11:28:14	fs0ciety	i'd just say just set up a irc channel that can be accessed via a web-page :)
2016-01-21 11:28:27	DrParis	that’s already a thing, but then there’s no scrollback
2016-01-21 11:28:40	DrParis	adhoc_: the free one is good enough; most of my friends use that to chat in our friends irc channel
2016-01-21 11:29:01	adhoc_	its another busuness model looking for a problem =)
2016-01-21 11:29:04	edunham	faulteh_: that's neat! for "Quitter", is there a heuristic for deciding whether to hit the Sweden, Norway, or Iceland button?
2016-01-21 11:29:21	DrParis	adhoc_: I think their business model is quite solid TBH –– I pay
2016-01-21 11:29:49	faulteh_	edunham: i'm not sure i was on LoadAverage for a while but now I run my own instance of gnusocial since it's all federated, even set one up for TasLUG to replace wordpress hehe

2016-01-21 13:39:45	brong	we booked a large AirBnB close to the conference for whoever from the company wants to crash on any night :)
2016-01-21 13:39:59	brong	somehow I got accepted as a speaker
2016-01-21 13:40:14	brong	I suspect it was a mistake, but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the camera
2016-01-21 13:40:58	KathyReid	brong: with my Speaker Liaison hat on, I can definitively say it was not a mistake
2016-01-21 13:41:11	brong	excellent
2016-01-21 13:41:15	brong	I guess I should write my talk then
2016-01-21 13:41:42	KathyReid	brong: first rule of Speaking, don't tell the Speaker Liaison you haven't written your talk :D
2016-01-21 13:41:49	KathyReid	<-- #WrathyKathy
2016-01-21 13:41:59	brong	oh, I mean - I guess I should _polish_ my talk
2016-01-21 13:42:13	KathyReid	correct :-) 
2016-01-21 13:42:43	teolupus	I've got a registration code (voucher) provided by my company, but I'm getting a sold out error message from the website. Is there a way I can claim back this ticket online?
2016-01-21 13:42:53	brong	I'll crack out a bucket of TurdSparkle2000Plus[tm]
2016-01-21 13:43:02	thaytan	KathyReid, I prefer to write my talks the night before
2016-01-21 13:43:06	thaytan	so it's all fresh in my mind
2016-01-21 13:43:23	KathyReid	teolupus: drop me a line at contact@lcabythebay.org.au with your details. If you have a voucher code, we can register you
2016-01-21 13:43:23	thaytan	otherwise, how do you know what you were going to say?
2016-01-21 13:43:41	brong	thaytan: I was planning to make it all up on the spot
2016-01-21 13:43:47	teolupus	KathyReid: will do. You should have an email form me in the next 3min.
2016-01-21 13:43:49	*	KathyReid twitches nervously
2016-01-21 13:43:50	brong	"hi, I'm Bron - any questions?"
2016-01-21 13:43:56	thaytan	brong, the freshest of fresh!
2016-01-21 13:44:13	thaytan	best to peruse the CoC a little beforehand
2016-01-21 13:44:17	KathyReid	next you guys will be staying you don't rehearse your talk
2016-01-21 13:44:26	KathyReid	teolupus: great stuff, thank you
2016-01-21 13:44:34	brong	<flandersandswan>they practice beforehand, which ruins the fun</>
2016-01-21 13:44:59	*	brong nips over to slack to sell a different story
2016-01-21 13:45:11	thaytan	KathyReid, to me, rehearse is just a car you use for the 2nd funeral
2016-01-21 13:45:40	*	KathyReid twitches more nervously
2016-01-21 13:46:09	JackScott	brong: Make sure you include a live demo too, those always go well.
2016-01-21 13:46:10	zindello	with regards to staying at LCA, I learned a long time ago that staying on or near campus is a must to get the most out of it
2016-01-21 13:46:34	brong	oh man - I wish I had a video of the last time I did a live demo
2016-01-21 13:46:43	brong	in front of the entire company :)
2016-01-21 13:46:48	zindello	The conversations that go on, after hours, after a lot of beer, are priceless and every bit as valuable as the conference content its self (If you can remember them the next morning that is!)
2016-01-21 13:46:53	brong	I shut down a production web server in the middle of my talk
2016-01-21 13:47:01	brong	told it to reinstall itself
2016-01-21 13:47:03	robn`	yeah, I was just about to say that
2016-01-21 13:47:10	robn`	what brong calls "live demo" the rest of us call "production"
2016-01-21 13:47:12	 - 	robn` is now known as robn
2016-01-21 13:47:19	brong	got to the end of my talk and there was a slide saying "don't forget to bring web5 back up"
2016-01-21 13:47:22	zindello	Haha
2016-01-21 13:47:27	zindello	I love doing autoscaling demonstations
2016-01-21 13:47:32	brong	so I switched to the console where the reinstall had finished and brought it back into production
2016-01-21 13:47:39	zindello	"Here we have 6 servers in production" I'm just going to shutdown -h 3 of them
2016-01-21 13:47:49	zindello	"Here hold my beer"
2016-01-21 13:48:15	teolupus	KathyReid: done. I have provided all the details requested by the registration form on the email. Let me know if you need anything else.
2016-01-21 13:48:16	brong	{emoji response}
2016-01-21 13:49:23	robn	brong: that's just lazy 😎
2016-01-21 13:49:29	brong	ok, enough harassing organisers - I'm going to go pretend I understand email RFCs for real for a bit

2016-01-21 15:14:34	craige	Heya evil_steve. I'm going bring some scotch to LCA so I can lure you to comfy couch some where and talk at length admin work and other related matters (if you saw my eail from some weeks ago).
2016-01-21 15:15:18	fs0ciety	craige: that sounded pretty creepy
2016-01-21 15:15:20	fs0ciety	;)
2016-01-21 15:16:44	hoju37	A bottle of scotch attached to a length of string?
2016-01-21 15:16:57	tserong	there'll probably be a net, too
2016-01-21 15:17:29	bradm	does the scotch have ACME written down the side?
2016-01-21 15:17:39	 > 	ccaffeini (crazyed@wrongplanet/CrazyEddy) has joined #linux.conf.au
2016-01-21 15:17:56	tserong	i expect it to go a bit like this: http://i.giphy.com/dybLdL1l7mB6o.gif
2016-01-21 15:18:05	craige	Was meant to fs0ciety. evil_steve likes it that way.
2016-01-21 15:18:36	tserong	(that vid is from http://www.nature.com/news/when-chickens-go-wild-1.19195 BTW)
2016-01-21 15:21:10	craige	I prefer the sequel, Chickens on Spring Break.
2016-01-21 15:22:28	bradm	I was thinking more Road Runner and Wile E Coyote, but the classic one, not the new modern 3d version.

2016-01-21 16:42:32	evil_steve	adhoc_: I tend to find out about it 30 minutes into the event
2016-01-21 16:42:42	evil_steve	when someone messages me to say "hey, where are"
2016-01-21 16:46:39	evil_steve	craige: this is the "anyone can commit a change to the LA systems if they can find enough friends to upvote it" crowdsourced devops idea?
2016-01-21 16:49:21	craige	among many others evil_steve.
2016-01-21 16:49:24	aj	evil_steve: i read that as crowd-sourced content updates (wikipedia like) not devops (jenkins/openstack)
2016-01-21 16:49:45	craige	I need to do some high bandwidth listening evil_steve.
2016-01-21 16:50:05	craige	Then perhaps bounce some ideas around and see what sticks.
2016-01-21 16:54:01	evil_steve	sure
2016-01-21 16:54:16	evil_steve	aj: the example used was to resolve an issue with some apache configuration
2016-01-21 16:54:34	evil_steve	but I think Craige will need to bring several cases and a new liver, and we'll see what comes out of it
