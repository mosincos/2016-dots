2016-02-19 14:23:51	JasonCca	pretty much eliminated spam from my server now.
2016-02-19 14:24:07	NicholasB	did you turn ot off?
2016-02-19 14:24:09	JasonCca	kind of sad though, now I just get emails
2016-02-19 14:24:27	@fsociety	hahaha
2016-02-19 14:24:33	JasonCca	yea, multiple times during the process...
2016-02-19 14:25:25	@fsociety	now Jason its time to use linux as your primary OS if you are in here
2016-02-19 14:25:37	JasonCca	rbls actually work
2016-02-19 14:26:04	@fsociety	i want to see win removed from your machine by the end of the week
2016-02-19 14:26:05	@fsociety	no buts
2016-02-19 14:26:08	@fsociety	;)
2016-02-19 14:26:21	@fsociety	now that vulkan is released, you have no choice in the matter
2016-02-19 14:26:32	JasonCca	yes yes, was reading up on kvm and sli, apparently it works, but there is still a lot of cpu overhead, I'll have to grab another drive so I can dual boot
2016-02-19 14:26:42	@fsociety	naa.. no kvm
2016-02-19 14:26:47	@fsociety	pure posix wonder ;)
2016-02-19 14:27:21	@fsociety	even though systemd doesn't give a flying fuck about posix standards
2016-02-19 14:27:33	*	JasonCca nods
2016-02-19 14:28:01	@fsociety	started playing grid autosport last night, its strangely addictive
2016-02-19 14:28:24	NicholasB	yeah i bought it on sale the other week. was gunna put on a pot of caoffee and have a drive.
2016-02-19 14:28:29	@fsociety	though i had to patch the kernel because there is a weird bug with the xbox 360s rumble function and X server locking up
2016-02-19 14:28:45	@fsociety	so if you use an xbox 360 controller patch the kernel or turn off rumble functions
2016-02-19 14:29:00	@fsociety	we could have systemau races
2016-02-19 14:29:02	NicholasB	it works fine on my machine.
2016-02-19 14:29:14	NicholasB	but i use a xbox clone
2016-02-19 14:29:17	NicholasB	so maybe thats it
2016-02-19 14:29:20	@fsociety	it was due to a regression on the new kernels
2016-02-19 14:29:37	@fsociety	if you run the standard ubuntu kernel you are fine, but if you are running something like 4.4 then you have to patch
2016-02-19 14:29:45	NicholasB	ahh
2016-02-19 14:30:03	@fsociety	but yes online systemau telegram races
2016-02-19 14:30:10	@fsociety	that would be amusing actually
2016-02-19 14:30:21	@fsociety	probably be a game of everybody trying to hit everyone off the track
2016-02-19 14:31:49	NicholasB	i think coffin dogers would be more enjoyable
2016-02-19 14:31:53	NicholasB	for shits and giigles.
2016-02-19 14:31:57	@fsociety	i will look this up
