2016-03-02 13:17:40	beedz	yo... changed my nick
2016-03-02 13:21:04	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-02 13:21:12	fs0ciety	fair enough 
2016-03-02 13:21:15	beedz	had to cloak IP
2016-03-02 13:21:25	beedz	don't feel safe with my IP showing haha
2016-03-02 13:21:31	fs0ciety	on freenode? i doubt anyone would go after you on freenode
2016-03-02 13:21:38	fs0ciety	efnet on the other hand - is a different story
2016-03-02 13:21:39	beedz	but still..
2016-03-02 13:21:49	beedz	it's kinda like walking down the street with your fly undone
2016-03-02 13:21:56	beedz	bad analogy but yeah.. haha
2016-03-02 13:22:19	beedz	messaged staff member... did it instantly
2016-03-02 13:24:20	fs0ciety	haha through irc?
2016-03-02 13:27:17	fs0ciety	so you still playing with linux still?
2016-03-02 13:28:09	beedz	yeah dude.. just did /staff p  and messaged 'c' asked and he said 'done' haha
2016-03-02 13:28:43	beedz	yeah i still dabble.. My laptop is dual boot (though I used windows mainly) my Pi2 (which i'm chatting from) is debian
2016-03-02 13:28:53	beedz	love this little thing, so stable
2016-03-02 13:29:06	beedz	has been on 24/7 for like 10months now (maybe more)
2016-03-02 13:29:22	fs0ciety	and now the pi3 just got released
2016-03-02 13:29:25	beedz	oh.. my main PC is running win10 now.. great OS
2016-03-02 13:29:32	beedz	yeah i saw that.. not too much of an upgrade
2016-03-02 13:29:43	beedz	little more CPU power and 64bit.. meh
2016-03-02 13:29:52	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-02 13:29:54	beedz	i still have my pi1
2016-03-02 13:30:02	fs0ciety	ive been using gentoo for the past 8 months or so
2016-03-02 13:30:02	beedz	gathering dust.. should use it for something
2016-03-02 13:30:14	fs0ciety	something i would recommend installing on a pi.. would take weeks to instal
2016-03-02 13:30:39	beedz	debian is perfect for the pi
2016-03-02 13:30:45	beedz	quite lightweight
2016-03-02 13:31:12	beedz	this pi2 is a fair machine for its size. Stable running mysql/php/nginx etc
2016-03-02 13:32:15	fs0ciety	here is something for you to laugh.. look at what happens when you try and compile ue4
2016-03-02 13:32:32	fs0ciety	https://u.teknik.io/uD9m1.png
2016-03-02 13:35:20	beedz	100% across 4 cores? haha
2016-03-02 13:35:43	fs0ciety	and the ram usage just for compiling is crazy
2016-03-02 13:35:54	fs0ciety	even though its not using anywhere near close to what my machine has
2016-03-02 13:36:01	fs0ciety	its gonna take a few hours i think
2016-03-02 13:36:38	beedz	shouldn't you be using UE4 in windows?
2016-03-02 13:36:42	fs0ciety	haha you seemed tired when i saw you
2016-03-02 13:36:45	beedz	it would be more stable I'm guessing?
2016-03-02 13:36:45	fs0ciety	no
2016-03-02 13:36:59	fs0ciety	because i'm compiling my friends project in linux to see performance differences
2016-03-02 13:37:15	fs0ciety	directx performance vs opengl performance
2016-03-02 13:37:16	beedz	yeah... late night haha. Time for another coffee in a min ;)
2016-03-02 13:37:22	beedz	ahh ok sweet
2016-03-02 13:37:47	beedz	coffee time brb :)
2016-03-02 13:39:42	fs0ciety	haha sure
2016-03-02 13:39:57	fs0ciety	so do you use tmux or screen to attach and detach irc sessions
2016-03-02 13:44:42	beedz	ahh thats better
2016-03-02 13:44:56	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-02 13:45:04	beedz	i don't usually use it for irc sessions.. 
2016-03-02 13:45:08	beedz	i use screen
2016-03-02 13:45:17	fs0ciety	ahh tmux man myself
2016-03-02 13:45:17	beedz	mainly if i want to connect to vpn
2016-03-02 13:45:26	beedz	screen sudo /etc/openvpn blah
2016-03-02 13:45:43	beedz	actually i might screen this.. brb
2016-03-02 13:45:48	fs0ciety	i use it to connect and disconnect between different sessions.  especially if i want to attach to a terminal that is in mid compiling or something
2016-03-02 13:45:49	 - 	beedz: No such nick/channel
2016-03-02 13:46:39	beedz	thats better
2016-03-02 13:46:52	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-02 13:46:59	fs0ciety	whats your irc client look like these days
2016-03-02 13:47:01	fs0ciety	screenie me
2016-03-02 13:47:06	beedz	oh dude.. stock as
2016-03-02 13:47:12	beedz	i havent been on irc for ages
2016-03-02 13:47:19	beedz	i miss it though
2016-03-02 13:47:39	fs0ciety	i usually sit an irc server called unixchat - which is all about desktop ricing 
2016-03-02 13:47:40	beedz	and as i do everything via ssh through my pi2 i cant be bothered customising
2016-03-02 13:48:06	fs0ciety	that and i've setup telegram to run through bitlbee.  along with my standard freenode chans..
2016-03-02 13:48:22	beedz	what's bitlbee?
2016-03-02 13:48:48	fs0ciety	go to bitlbee.org
2016-03-02 13:48:59	fs0ciety	you can even connect your steam account to irc :)
2016-03-02 13:51:34	beedz	ahh sweet
2016-03-02 13:51:52	beedz	so its kinda like connecting through a bnc server that consolidates all your instant messaging protocols
2016-03-02 13:52:14	beedz	actually.. i used this i think!
2016-03-02 13:52:24	beedz	a while back when i had linux on my desktop main machine
2016-03-02 13:52:40	beedz	had facebook chat running though it
2016-03-02 13:52:54	fs0ciety	yeah i think you did as well
2016-03-02 13:54:22	fs0ciety	im trying the steam plugin now
2016-03-02 13:54:30	fs0ciety	couldn't get it working last time, but there have been several revisions since
2016-03-02 13:56:00	fs0ciety	any plans for the weekend
2016-03-02 13:56:07	fs0ciety	i remember ages ago you txted me to do a nerd hangout
2016-03-02 13:57:01	fs0ciety	acc add steam polymetric 3NJ5jQ?bBXe>d+\4&p

2016-03-02 13:57:20	fs0ciety	as you can see im quite tired today
2016-03-02 13:57:45	beedz	hahaha
2016-03-02 13:57:49	beedz	nice pass
2016-03-02 13:58:03	fs0ciety	haha yeah
2016-03-02 13:58:38	beedz	free this weekend by the way man :)
2016-03-02 13:58:48	beedz	(apart from work sat)
2016-03-02 13:58:57	fs0ciety	ahh nice
2016-03-02 13:59:10	fs0ciety	i guess since circles isn't around you have tons more free time
2016-03-02 14:00:07	fs0ciety	or does circles still exist?
2016-03-02 14:07:04	beedz	oh man i thought you knew (i guess not as you're not on facebook anymore).. I departed circles before xmas
2016-03-02 14:07:17	beedz	was getting a bit tired of it.. wanted more time to myself
2016-03-02 14:07:23	beedz	to do my own thing etc
2016-03-02 14:07:29	beedz	still good mates with the boys though
2016-03-02 14:07:42	fs0ciety	ahh yeah man, im not any social networking sites at all
2016-03-02 14:07:50	fs0ciety	i know how it feels
2016-03-02 14:07:54	beedz	they got Ben from glass empire on guitar, he's pretty good
2016-03-02 14:08:29	fs0ciety	bands eat time, don't get me wrong.. if i got asked to join the right band i would.. but it will never be full time
2016-03-02 14:15:07	fs0ciety	im so out of touch with people and social media
2016-03-02 14:15:09	fs0ciety	refreshing though
2016-03-02 14:24:41	beedz	yeah man i'm seriously considering it
2016-03-02 14:25:18	beedz	I love IRC which is a social media i guess.. but it's not cancerous like all of todays shit.. especially facebook
2016-03-02 14:25:45	beedz	yeah the circles boys released a new track last week.. it's different
2016-03-02 14:26:00	beedz	it's okay... i guess they will gain some fans and lose some
2016-03-02 14:26:28	beedz	also.. 90% of the music is done by Ted anyway.. I like to have 100% creative freedom with music :)
2016-03-02 14:26:41	fs0ciety	you just kind of end up being a session muso
2016-03-02 14:26:49	fs0ciety	another reason why i left transience
2016-03-02 14:26:59	fs0ciety	one of the "many" reasons
2016-03-02 14:27:13	beedz	exactly how I felt for a long time man
2016-03-02 14:27:29	beedz	even though I had some amazing experiences I never would've had (touring europe twice)
2016-03-02 14:27:35	fs0ciety	haha on saying that i created a fuck around drum video, with those practice heads
2016-03-02 14:27:37	fs0ciety	i'll find it for you
2016-03-02 14:27:44	beedz	haha sweet
2016-03-02 14:27:47	fs0ciety	i was testing the camera on the htc one m9 to see how shit it was
2016-03-02 14:27:51	beedz	gonna go for a quick smoke brb
2016-03-02 14:28:43	fs0ciety	https://youtu.be/biDCaO6kvnc
2016-03-02 14:28:54	fs0ciety	note i was trying to be quiet because of the neighbours, now they dont care
2016-03-02 14:36:54	beedz	haha mad virgil chops with the trad grip
2016-03-02 14:39:35	fs0ciety	haha yeah
2016-03-02 14:39:41	fs0ciety	i wish i was virgil good
2016-03-02 14:39:45	fs0ciety	but i got the trad thing down pat
2016-03-02 14:39:51	fs0ciety	i can only play trad really
2016-03-02 14:40:31	fs0ciety	considering i was taught by virgil's first major drum teacher is pretty amusing i guess
2016-03-02 14:40:40	fs0ciety	his name is brian czempinski
2016-03-02 14:40:53	fs0ciety	should i pretend to get a lisssppppp
2016-03-02 14:41:01	fs0ciety	maybe if i get one i can get virgil chops
2016-03-02 14:41:02	beedz	hahaha
2016-03-02 14:41:25	beedz	so what else is news with you man?
2016-03-02 14:41:33	fs0ciety	but yeah transience tried to simplifier my drumming and thats why i left
2016-03-02 14:41:34	fs0ciety	me
2016-03-02 14:41:36	fs0ciety	errr...
2016-03-02 14:41:45	fs0ciety	lots of hobbyist programming on the side i guess
2016-03-02 14:42:00	fs0ciety	i want to make a steven seagal side scrolling beat em up
2016-03-02 14:42:06	fs0ciety	every level is a parody of one of his movies
2016-03-02 14:42:13	fs0ciety	the more you move forward the fatter he gets
2016-03-02 14:42:28	fs0ciety	for eg. under siege episode right at the start he eats himself out of the cake
2016-03-02 14:42:47	fs0ciety	his ultra special attack is his bad guitar playing
2016-03-02 14:42:51	beedz	hahahaha that would be hilarious
2016-03-02 14:42:59	fs0ciety	i know and it hasn't been done
2016-03-02 14:43:05	fs0ciety	so i'm slowly writing the engine
2016-03-02 14:43:35	fs0ciety	cut scenes where he mumbles all the way through (no subtitles) for him. and all of the side characters are just going "wtf.. i have no idea what he is saying"
2016-03-02 14:43:39	beedz	gonna make it pixel gfx style?
2016-03-02 14:43:43	fs0ciety	yeah
2016-03-02 14:43:47	beedz	nicd
2016-03-02 14:43:48	beedz	nice
2016-03-02 14:44:02	fs0ciety	the whole double dragon, final fight kinda thing
2016-03-02 14:44:21	fs0ciety	i know if i were to sell it, it would go pretty viral i'd imagine
2016-03-02 14:44:26	fs0ciety	but it will be just a freebie
2016-03-02 14:44:37	beedz	nah.. at least make it 99c
2016-03-02 14:44:45	beedz	you never know.. might end up with a couple of grand
2016-03-02 14:45:11	fs0ciety	haha get an email from steven "you knnooowww, i have connections to the mafia here... (i don't really).. but i can get you with my marvellous drawn on hair line."
2016-03-02 14:46:12	fs0ciety	all i've been doing lately though is learning more low-level kernel stuff. umm.. wanting to make a new game.. and playing drums a fair amount - no band or nothing.. just to myself
2016-03-02 14:47:06	fs0ciety	i have no idea what the melbourne music scene is like anymore.. not being on social networking doesn't help.. haha
2016-03-02 14:47:15	beedz	same shit really
2016-03-02 14:47:27	beedz	i've kinda lost interest 
2016-03-02 14:47:31	beedz	in a professional sense
2016-03-02 14:47:40	beedz	just want to play for fun/myself now
2016-03-02 14:47:50	fs0ciety	yeah same
2016-03-02 14:48:08	fs0ciety	i know have chops.. but the problem with most musos is that they don't have secondary interests
2016-03-02 14:48:18	fs0ciety	so its consumes them, and if it doesn't consume you they get shitty. haha
2016-03-02 14:48:47	beedz	exactly
2016-03-02 14:49:12	beedz	and I don't really have any friends on my nerd level either
2016-03-02 14:49:17	beedz	except you haha
2016-03-02 14:49:31	fs0ciety	XD.... i know another guy you'd get along with really well
2016-03-02 14:49:41	fs0ciety	he started work here.. uber unix admin - loves all the same games you do
2016-03-02 14:49:47	fs0ciety	builds stuff for ark and stuff
2016-03-02 14:50:05	fs0ciety	he comes over all the time.. hes a lot of fun to be around and talk nerd with
2016-03-02 14:52:25	beedz	awesome
2016-03-02 14:52:36	beedz	well i'm low level nerd compared to you guys haha
2016-03-02 14:53:56	fs0ciety	hahaha
2016-03-02 14:54:17	fs0ciety	if you ever decide to chill, i'll give him a buzz and i'll get him down
2016-03-02 14:55:17	beedz	we could masscan ISP IP ranges for open ports, gain access to routers with default admin passwords and brick them
2016-03-02 14:55:20	beedz	you know for fun
2016-03-02 14:55:22	beedz	hahahahaha jk
2016-03-02 14:55:35	fs0ciety	oh he owns 50 static ips
2016-03-02 14:55:50	beedz	VPS?
2016-03-02 14:56:01	fs0ciety	nope.. ISP bound
2016-03-02 14:56:08	fs0ciety	he used to know the guy who ran melbourne it
2016-03-02 14:56:14	beedz	oh cool.. so he'd have reverse lookup for them then
2016-03-02 14:56:19	beedz	ahh awesome
2016-03-02 14:56:25	fs0ciety	my friend used to work for ibm and other huge places
2016-03-02 14:56:27	beedz	did he ever work at an isp?
2016-03-02 14:56:31	fs0ciety	he ran one
2016-03-02 14:56:51	beedz	what was it called?
2016-03-02 14:56:58	fs0ciety	im not sure to be honest but i can find out
2016-03-02 14:57:33	fs0ciety	they guy even one ups me sometimes on the computer knowledge level. we kind of go in and out of knowledge with each other.  its kinda cool. so we kind of learn off each other
2016-03-02 14:57:37	fs0ciety	he is 5 years older than me though
2016-03-02 14:58:06	fs0ciety	but yeah.. a thought :)
2016-03-02 14:58:29	beedz	yeah man.. if you're free sat night I can come down after work
2016-03-02 14:58:41	fs0ciety	id imagine if you wanted to start some super nerd like project you, him and i could figure something out
2016-03-02 14:58:44	fs0ciety	im always free sir
2016-03-02 14:59:33	beedz	that would be awesome
2016-03-02 15:00:05	fs0ciety	im always looking for new projects to have fun with.. and tbh you and him are probably the most proactive out of the nerds that i know
2016-03-02 15:00:12	fs0ciety	the others like to "talk" but not do anything
2016-03-02 15:00:29	beedz	I don't do much.. because I can't get the focus
2016-03-02 15:00:35	beedz	i need something to focus on
2016-03-02 15:00:37	beedz	haha
2016-03-02 15:01:15	fs0ciety	haha.. yeah.. do have you have ideas that pop into your head
2016-03-02 15:01:20	fs0ciety	i'm curious to see where you are at?
2016-03-02 15:01:23	beedz	i always wanted to start up an awesome looking forum site but.. starting up is too hard (getting users) etc etc
2016-03-02 15:01:29	fs0ciety	ahh yeah
2016-03-02 15:01:41	beedz	game dev is cool but i dunno
2016-03-02 15:01:45	fs0ciety	you know i figured out a way how to create a whole ncurses website in a browser window
2016-03-02 15:02:45	beedz	ncurses? like the dos looking menu systems?
2016-03-02 15:02:51	fs0ciety	haha yeah
2016-03-02 15:03:22	beedz	thats sweet :)
2016-03-02 15:03:44	beedz	another 'project' i've always wanted to do is some secret kinda 'club' or 'group'
2016-03-02 15:03:53	fs0ciety	yeah the group thing sounds appealing
2016-03-02 15:03:53	beedz	but again.. subject matter lol
2016-03-02 15:04:09	beedz	it all tends to fall back on scene stuff
2016-03-02 15:04:13	fs0ciety	hacking tools maybe
2016-03-02 15:04:15	beedz	eg.. illegal software haha
2016-03-02 15:04:22	fs0ciety	find black market toolsets
2016-03-02 15:04:26	beedz	possibly
2016-03-02 15:04:34	beedz	metasploit is popular for that though
2016-03-02 15:04:39	fs0ciety	true
2016-03-02 15:04:46	fs0ciety	i could write some
2016-03-02 15:04:49	fs0ciety	hahahaha
2016-03-02 15:04:59	beedz	haha
2016-03-02 15:05:12	fs0ciety	but i dont think i could deal with the morality of it
2016-03-02 15:05:45	fs0ciety	but yes so for example your old bbs
2016-03-02 15:05:58	fs0ciety	i figured out how to make it load seamlessly into a browser window
2016-03-02 15:07:55	beedz	thats pretty awesome
2016-03-02 15:08:28	beedz	yeh.. I think some kinda of exclusive 'group' would be a cool project
2016-03-02 15:08:46	fs0ciety	just have to figure out content
2016-03-02 15:09:05	fs0ciety	i reckon a website to replace the old torrent site that used to hold really rare abandonware
2016-03-02 15:09:10	beedz	every time i think of something cool though... yeah, then thinking about content just stops the idea in its tracks haha
2016-03-02 15:09:12	fs0ciety	underground-gamer it was called
2016-03-02 15:09:20	fs0ciety	but they disappeared along with their content
2016-03-02 15:09:22	beedz	thats cool
2016-03-02 15:09:45	fs0ciety	so like rare console, pc ports... stuff like that
2016-03-02 15:09:55	fs0ciety	would write little reviews on the games etc.
2016-03-02 15:10:17	fs0ciety	could even imitate your bbs front end through python and so when you click on a download it downloads at full speed
2016-03-02 15:10:41	beedz	yeah.. something that looks cool and different (well back to oldschool)
2016-03-02 15:10:52	fs0ciety	and still be hidden enough
2016-03-02 15:10:52	beedz	i'm kinda sick of all the samey looking wordpress sites these days
2016-03-02 15:11:02	fs0ciety	hahaha. wordpress = security nightmare
2016-03-02 15:11:14	beedz	i love the full exclusive/private type appeal like dognzb
2016-03-02 15:11:30	fs0ciety	yeah def. setup an irc server with some eggshells of new releases as they appear
2016-03-02 15:11:31	beedz	gives you a privilidged feeling being approved access etc
2016-03-02 15:11:32	fs0ciety	that kind of thing
2016-03-02 15:11:41	fs0ciety	being abandonware its harder for anyone to go really after us as well
2016-03-02 15:12:07	beedz	abandonware is kinda boring and easily accessable though
2016-03-02 15:12:16	beedz	but i guess anything else could land you in shit hah
2016-03-02 15:12:45	beedz	hmmmm
2016-03-02 15:12:52	beedz	i'm liking the brainstorming though ;)
2016-03-02 15:12:57	beedz	keep it going haha
2016-03-02 15:13:07	fs0ciety	that type of thing can branch out
2016-03-02 15:13:19	fs0ciety	you could upload certain rls's to usenet being obfuscated for example
2016-03-02 15:16:32	fs0ciety	goddamn it steam aren't sending me my steam guard codes to my email
2016-03-02 15:16:36	fs0ciety	they just aren't appearing
2016-03-02 15:25:10	beedz	I also thought of some kind of alternative social site other than facebook (no tracking,ads etc) but that is just too big to take on.. and people are addicted to fb anyway
2016-03-02 15:25:18	beedz	i definitely think something underground
2016-03-02 15:25:39	beedz	fake front page kinda thing
2016-03-02 15:25:48	beedz	very secret and only people in the know can get in
2016-03-02 15:25:55	beedz	very much like dognzb i guess
2016-03-02 15:26:32	beedz	how their front page goes to a wikipedia page unless you specify login in the url
2016-03-02 15:26:39	fs0ciety	haha yeah
2016-03-02 15:26:58	fs0ciety	there is a cool social networking thing going on which is very hackerish i'll find it
2016-03-02 15:28:01	beedz	sweet.
2016-03-02 15:28:56	beedz	it could be a site/forum/etc about usenet and automating downloads, so full instructions on setting up sabnzb/couchpotato/sonar.. custom kodi addons etc etc
2016-03-02 15:29:55	fs0ciety	humhub.org looks interesting
2016-03-02 15:34:23	beedz	trying to check the demo.. not working yet hah
2016-03-02 15:34:32	beedz	sounds interesting though
2016-03-02 15:36:52	beedz	i want a system to be fully anon though.. no real names, just aliases etc
2016-03-02 15:39:23	beedz	hmm
2016-03-02 15:39:56	fs0ciety	going through social networking code on github to see what i can find
2016-03-02 15:44:00	beedz	hmm.. could be a private scene news site
2016-03-02 15:44:10	beedz	conspiracy theory site hah
2016-03-02 15:45:04	beedz	scene resources..hmm trying to brainstorm here
2016-03-02 15:46:28	fs0ciety	geti2p.net
2016-03-02 15:46:34	fs0ciety	this seems interesting
2016-03-02 15:49:30	beedz	yeah that sounds pretty cool
2016-03-02 15:50:31	fs0ciety	 movim.eu
2016-03-02 15:50:33	fs0ciety	booom found it
2016-03-02 15:50:42	fs0ciety	a social networking platform that lets you be anonymous
2016-03-02 15:50:43	beedz	soudns like running a tor node though.
2016-03-02 15:51:03	fs0ciety	can install an instance and modify the code, etc.
2016-03-02 15:51:55	beedz	movim looks cool~
2016-03-02 15:53:02	fs0ciety	yeah it does
2016-03-02 15:54:10	fs0ciety	uses xmpp as a backend, i have an xmpp server already setup currently
2016-03-02 15:54:14	beedz	always wanted to bring back old school chat (ala IRC) but more accessible like in a website
2016-03-02 15:54:33	fs0ciety	well this is it.. edit the css and make it look like something for the late 80s
2016-03-02 15:54:33	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-02 15:54:46	beedz	and ive tried ALL the chat plugins from php full systems to javascript codes that link IRC servers to a websiet.. they are all crap
2016-03-02 15:54:54	beedz	oh hell yeah
2016-03-02 15:55:08	beedz	modern site with nostalgic looks/values
2016-03-02 15:55:12	beedz	thats what i want ;)
2016-03-02 15:55:30	fs0ciety	edit to imitate a bbs even
2016-03-02 15:55:41	fs0ciety	so make ansi art but convert to pngs and go yay :)
2016-03-02 15:56:00	fs0ciety	could use one of the many terminus fonts that are converted to ttf as well for that old school look
2016-03-02 15:56:02	fs0ciety	like my desktop font
2016-03-02 15:56:24	fs0ciety	going to bookmark this webapp
2016-03-02 15:57:52	beedz	yeah exactly.. make the site look like an old scene bbs and have all the modern functionality :)
2016-03-02 15:58:13	beedz	love the look of the chat room. Chat rooms need to make a come back and i think they will eventually
2016-03-02 15:58:45	beedz	lets just hope facebook don't monopolise on it as i'm sure they are working on it as we speak haha
2016-03-02 15:59:56	beedz	got a test-server you can deploy this on so we can have a fuck around?
2016-03-02 16:04:53	beedz	you can code your own widgets too
2016-03-02 16:05:41	fs0ciety	yeah dude.. i could set up another vps instance.. or create a docker instance on my home server.. the later will probably be better just to see what it is like
2016-03-02 16:05:43	fs0ciety	i'll set it up tonight
2016-03-02 16:08:22	beedz	sweet
2016-03-02 16:10:29	fs0ciety	if you are on irc i'll poke ya
2016-03-02 16:10:32	fs0ciety	if not i'll txt ya
2016-03-02 16:10:46	beedz	sounds good
2016-03-02 16:10:58	beedz	i'm gonna chuck it on my raspberry pi now and have a quick look
2016-03-02 16:12:55	fs0ciety	ahh awesome.. send me a url if you beat me to the punch
2016-03-02 16:15:08	fs0ciety	i logged onto one of their hosted versions
2016-03-02 16:15:10	fs0ciety	i already like it
2016-03-02 16:20:26	beedz	yeah looks very promising! 
2016-03-02 16:21:45	beedz	will probably need it deployed on one of your machines if you have a VPS :)
2016-03-02 16:22:36	beedz	don't know how the little Pi will handle it hah
2016-03-02 16:22:40	beedz	and not much space on it
2016-03-02 16:23:17	fs0ciety	haha all good. ill do it when i get home
2016-03-02 16:25:52	beedz	sudo curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
2016-03-02 16:26:00	beedz	-bash: php: command not found
2016-03-02 16:26:04	beedz	bah
2016-03-02 16:26:11	fs0ciety	you need to install php5
2016-03-02 16:26:11	fs0ciety	hahaha
2016-03-02 16:26:19	fs0ciety	ahh it uses php composer
2016-03-02 16:26:21	beedz	it's installed
2016-03-02 16:26:29	beedz	and php5-fpm
2016-03-02 16:26:38	fs0ciety	what does it say when you type whereis php
2016-03-02 16:26:44	fs0ciety	or is the binary actually called php5
2016-03-02 16:27:00	beedz	php5: /etc/php5 /usr/lib/php5 /usr/share/php5
2016-03-02 16:27:22	beedz	/usr/share/nginx/www/movim
2016-03-02 16:27:28	beedz	thats my webserver dir
2016-03-02 16:27:44	beedz	http://211.30.48.118:600   for future reference
2016-03-02 16:27:54	beedz	:)
2016-03-02 16:28:21	beedz	sudo curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php5
2016-03-02 16:28:25	beedz	i thought that would work
2016-03-02 16:28:37	beedz	-bash: php5: command not found
2016-03-02 16:28:53	beedz	php def works though
2016-03-02 16:29:05	fs0ciety	you dont have it installed

2016-03-02 16:39:17	beedz	Linux orbit 4.1.13-v7+ #826 SMP PREEMPT Fri Nov 13 20:19:03 GMT 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux

2016-03-02 16:42:36	beedz	time for a friendly reboot haha.. brb
2016-03-02 16:51:26	fs0ciety	linux orbit
2016-03-02 16:51:34	fs0ciety	i have not heard of this distro, let me looky up
2016-03-02 16:51:50	beedz	back
2016-03-02 16:51:56	beedz	lol
2016-03-02 16:51:58	beedz	thats my hostname
2016-03-02 16:52:06	beedz	was... it's back to localhost now
2016-03-02 16:52:10	fs0ciety	whats the actual distro
2016-03-02 16:52:11	beedz	:)
2016-03-02 16:52:17	beedz	it's debian wheezy
2016-03-02 16:52:21	fs0ciety	ahh wheezy
2016-03-02 16:53:03	fs0ciety	what happens when you type "which php"
2016-03-02 16:54:31	beedz	nothing
2016-03-02 16:54:34	beedz	lol
2016-03-02 16:55:37	beedz	i got somewhere
2016-03-02 16:55:46	beedz	i'm using php-fpm
2016-03-02 16:55:55	beedz	so the binary is 'php-fpm'
2016-03-02 16:56:02	beedz	php5-fpm rather
2016-03-02 16:56:46	beedz	getting permission denied though which is weird
2016-03-02 16:57:02	beedz	i'll just wait for you to set it up,  might be a bit of a pain on the raspi
2016-03-02 16:57:12	beedz	:)
2016-03-02 16:58:12	beedz	some things are a pain in the ass to install/compile (because of the ARM architecture), some things are fine
2016-03-02 17:06:22	fs0ciety	use arch
2016-03-02 17:06:32	fs0ciety	make your life a little easier regarding packages
2016-03-02 17:06:46	beedz	i would/did if i used linux primarily
2016-03-02 17:10:41	fs0ciety	id say arch is easier than debian in many ways - wheezy is also nearly out of support,,
2016-03-02 17:11:05	beedz	debian is really good with the raspberry pi
2016-03-02 17:11:35	beedz	man.. looking forward to playing around with Movim
2016-03-02 17:11:43	fs0ciety	should be interesting
2016-03-02 17:12:38	beedz	when/if we get a site up... we can make an NFO and litter that around the scene haha
2016-03-02 17:20:25	fs0ciety	hahaha sure :)
2016-03-02 17:23:10	beedz	https://www.npmjs.com/package/press-enter
2016-03-02 17:23:44	fs0ciety	nodejs
2016-03-02 17:23:57	fs0ciety	hmm.. let me look at this
2016-03-02 17:24:23	beedz	i think thats for bbs's but because its node.js could possibly be integrated into a website
2016-03-02 17:25:15	fs0ciety	f.. i can even use this for my ncurses login manager im creating for myself.  really good find
2016-03-02 17:26:01	beedz	sweet! ;)
2016-03-02 17:27:56	fs0ciety	https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib
2016-03-02 17:28:48	fs0ciety	ive been playing around with this library as well as its parent library.  
2016-03-02 17:29:02	beedz	looks sweet!
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	just gonna put this here                    I still don't like that it requires superuser
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              yeah you can probably change that by installing the npm locally rather than
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   globally
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       Oh yeah
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   I still can't get it working, I'll try when I get home.
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              got it to run locally, just have to install gitter-cli locally rather than any
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   form of sudo :)
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   This isn't sh orientated, but its so easy to use you may find it come in handy

2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib.git
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       Neat thanks
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   My uni is done for the week, Swinburne is a unorganised place lol
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              yeah i know swinburne - hawthorn campus right?
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       Yeah
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              ahh my work is in blackburn :) not that far
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       Oh nice
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              if you get bored you know where to find me. haha
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       :+1:
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   What are some new features you'd like to see in neofetch?
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   I'm currently working on adding progress bar output for memory, cpu. battery
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   etc
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              hmmm.... to make a complete lemonbar ;)
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       You mean with --stdout?
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dean              yeah, i noticed you started something similar. but to generate a full nice
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   output would be awesome. but im guessing thats pushing the use of neofetch
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	 Dylan Araps       The script used to have the ability to print all of the info in a formatted
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   line but it required modifying too much of the info and prin functions and it
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   was slower than running fetch normally. The new --stdout func func func is
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   really fast and ideal because it makes no sense to have all of neofetch's info
2016-03-02 17:38:56	fs0ciety	                   in a bar.
2016-03-02 17:39:03	fs0ciety	oh wow

2016-03-02 17:41:07	beedz	probably  the best resource for ansi text
2016-03-02 17:41:34	beedz	roy/sac was one of the best
2016-03-02 17:41:46	fs0ciety	im gonna create an old school login manager for linux - so when you log into your pc it looks like a bbs login :)
2016-03-02 17:42:29	beedz	nice
2016-03-02 17:43:21	beedz	a thought... this site could be a whole community dedicated to late 90s/early 2000s internet nostalgia
2016-03-02 17:43:48	fs0ciety	go back...
2016-03-02 17:43:50	beedz	everything from bbs info to scene shit to how facebook ruined the internet
2016-03-02 17:43:53	beedz	hah
2016-03-02 17:43:59	fs0ciety	go from mid 80s to early 00s
2016-03-02 17:44:07	beedz	true
2016-03-02 17:44:51	beedz	well.. i'm gonna detach and i'll chat to ya when i get home
2016-03-02 17:45:08	beedz	should be on bout 7. See if you can get Movim up and running ;)
2016-03-02 17:56:59	 - 	irc: disconnected from server
2016-03-02 20:01:45	beedz	yo
2016-03-02 20:02:00	fs0ciety	there you are
2016-03-02 20:02:09	fs0ciety	sorry just got back from my friends house to get that replacement hdd
2016-03-02 20:02:15	beedz	haha.. lost your irc session?
2016-03-02 20:03:09	fs0ciety	well i had to go into windows.. decided i'll just make a daemon on my nas i think
2016-03-02 20:05:27	fs0ciety	currently looking to see if i can find a movim docker instance to save time
2016-03-02 20:05:52	beedz	i saw that you need an app to use it on mobile :/
2016-03-02 20:05:59	beedz	would be could if it was just responsive
2016-03-02 20:06:05	fs0ciety	you could probably just use a browser window i could imagine
2016-03-02 20:07:07	fs0ciety	looks like i'll have to make a container ;)
2016-03-02 20:07:24	beedz	to install it?
2016-03-02 20:07:39	fs0ciety	yeah docker containers are like vms but much more bare bones
2016-03-02 20:08:42	beedz	sweet
2016-03-02 20:09:01	beedz	what OS's?
2016-03-02 20:09:08	beedz	special cut-down distros?
2016-03-02 20:09:09	fs0ciety	for example i made a docker container that contains a vpn and a torrent client - so only torrent traffic routes through the vpn
2016-03-02 20:09:15	fs0ciety	all linux distros
2016-03-02 20:09:32	beedz	good way of seperating things
2016-03-02 20:09:35	fs0ciety	https://www.docker.com/
2016-03-02 20:13:23	beedz	thats handy!
2016-03-02 20:20:04	fs0ciety	for example im going to use this docker to install it
2016-03-02 20:20:10	fs0ciety	https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/how-to-install-docker-and-deploy-a-lamp-stack/
2016-03-02 20:20:19	fs0ciety	just keeps my nas tidy
2016-03-02 20:22:05	beedz	perfect..
2016-03-02 20:22:13	beedz	nginx or apache?
2016-03-02 20:26:37	fs0ciety	probably apache at this point, give it that tiny bit more grunt
2016-03-02 20:26:44	fs0ciety	couldn't be fucked fine tuning nginx at this point
2016-03-02 20:30:14	beedz	i found nginx quicker/easier to install than apache haha
2016-03-02 20:30:25	beedz	not enough power as apache though
2016-03-02 20:31:02	beedz	i'll brb
2016-03-02 20:47:03	 - 	irc: disconnected from server
2016-03-02 21:15:11	beedz	yo
2016-03-02 21:16:07	beedz	that was really strange.. hung on a black screen and wouldnt boot
2016-03-02 21:18:08	fs0ciety	ouchies
2016-03-02 21:18:23	beedz	couldnt even get to bios
2016-03-02 21:18:44	beedz	thought it might be power related.. unplugged some shit.. started up again and fine
2016-03-02 21:22:17	beedz	all good now

2016-03-02 22:25:10	beedz	its neat and looks great
2016-03-02 22:25:27	beedz	its phpbb though
2016-03-02 22:28:15	beedz	can be customised nicely though :)

2016-03-03 10:23:49	fs0ciety	i got distracted by my friends ue4 project.. didn't realise it would take so long to compile
2016-03-03 10:29:04	fs0ciety	i did try to install it though
2016-03-03 10:29:13	fs0ciety	i have to disable my ssl cert to get it working, or manually alter the config file
2016-03-03 10:29:18	fs0ciety	probably look at that today at work
2016-03-03 10:30:07	beedz	i think a sweet board we can customise will be better

2016-03-03 11:59:14	beedz	a plethora of extensions/plugins you can dive into as well ;)
2016-03-03 12:14:50	beedz	arg.. punishers
2016-03-03 12:28:24	beedz	hows work? busy?
2016-03-03 12:29:39	fs0ciety	yeah trying write a code generator in python to replace an old .net application for work
2016-03-03 12:29:50	fs0ciety	so it isn't windows only
2016-03-03 12:30:27	beedz	awesome.. looks like that png to svg converter worked well haha
2016-03-03 12:30:46	beedz	wanted an easy way to have a logo display responsively
2016-03-03 12:30:52	fs0ciety	ahh i see
2016-03-03 12:31:02	fs0ciety	i was meaning to look at those guys fonts in more detail last night.. but ran out of time
2016-03-03 12:31:10	beedz	svg is the go.. but i dont have illustrator :/
2016-03-03 12:31:23	beedz	thats what i used for the 'leet' text i did
2016-03-03 13:27:31	beedz	bleh
2016-03-03 13:29:09	fs0ciety	bleh?
2016-03-03 13:29:12	fs0ciety	that kind of day hey
2016-03-03 13:32:24	beedz	yeah i just want to do something haha
2016-03-03 13:32:44	beedz	like.. got the forum framework together now what lol
2016-03-03 13:32:57	beedz	prob only get 10 users :P
2016-03-03 13:36:30	fs0ciety	i still thinking hosting rare abandonware or something like that is probably the best way to get users
2016-03-03 13:36:41	fs0ciety	you need to offer them something, and then put the forum over the top of that
2016-03-03 13:40:14	beedz	people actually want abandonware?
2016-03-03 13:40:25	fs0ciety	yeah really rare stuff
2016-03-03 13:40:42	fs0ciety	of course people want abandonware look at gog
2016-03-03 13:43:14	beedz	true
2016-03-03 13:43:19	beedz	okay we can start with that :)
2016-03-03 13:43:29	beedz	got a good resource for it?
2016-03-03 13:44:09	fs0ciety	where usenet and torrent trauling comes in handy
2016-03-03 13:44:21	fs0ciety	you could even go the next step and making workable wrappers for said games
2016-03-03 13:44:30	fs0ciety	that alone would make things more popular
2016-03-03 13:47:03	beedz	i guess all this could be worked into phpbb?
2016-03-03 13:48:24	fs0ciety	most likely with plugins - i'd imagine
2016-03-03 13:48:36	fs0ciety	or there are probably a plethora of open source products you could use to deal with it
2016-03-03 13:53:34	beedz	http://www.goodolddays.net/article/id,-5/
2016-03-03 13:53:37	beedz	good read hehe
2016-03-03 13:53:41	beedz	from 2004
2016-03-03 14:08:14	fs0ciety	haha what a stupid article
2016-03-03 14:08:19	fs0ciety	the mass appeal of these games are long and dead
2016-03-03 14:08:22	fs0ciety	riiiiigghhhhtt
2016-03-03 14:08:29	fs0ciety	say that to all the remastering of old games

2016-03-03 14:55:50	beedz	sorry had to pull my lan plug so i could install/crack illustrator ;)
2016-03-03 14:56:04	fs0ciety	hahaha
2016-03-03 14:56:19	fs0ciety	or you could just install inkscape
2016-03-03 14:56:30	beedz	adobe all the way
2016-03-03 14:56:37	fs0ciety	closed-source all the way
2016-03-03 14:56:39	fs0ciety	how typical 
2016-03-03 14:56:44	beedz	haha
2016-03-03 14:57:05	beedz	i've tried alternatives (gimp etc).. quite horrible when you've used adobe for 10+ years hah
2016-03-03 14:58:09	fs0ciety	this what i don't get.. people go "oh its so horrible"... now lets take a step back for a second. adobe have unlimited funds whereas gimp is contributors
2016-03-03 14:58:33	fs0ciety	this is what annoys me about people who go "oh blah is better" without realising the mentality behind the product itself
2016-03-03 14:59:43	beedz	as far as a free program its awesome and functional.. but not what i'm used to
2016-03-03 14:59:57	fs0ciety	that is a better response
2016-03-03 14:59:58	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-03 15:00:01	beedz	a good analogy would be like me going from Cubase to Audacity for music
2016-03-03 15:00:15	fs0ciety	More so Cubase to Ardour
2016-03-03 15:00:18	beedz	audacity would probably do the job after a LOT of hair pulling and learning everything 
2016-03-03 15:01:10	beedz	funny.. because i installed gimp last night as i wanted to quickly do a logo and was having problems finding a good photoshop release to install... it hurt my brain
2016-03-03 15:01:18	beedz	didn't like it :)
2016-03-03 15:01:32	fs0ciety	i call that laziness
2016-03-03 15:01:34	beedz	also.. i've never given adobe any money so who cares haha
2016-03-03 15:02:32	beedz	thats actually another decent idea for a forum/board. A list of open-source alternatives to big budget programs
2016-03-03 15:02:44	fs0ciety	haha.. only your personal information ;) - indeed
2016-03-03 15:02:52	fs0ciety	as for open source game engines check out godot btw
2016-03-03 15:02:55	fs0ciety	its actually on steam
2016-03-03 15:03:04	beedz	laziness?  haha knowing my way around photoshop for years and having to learn another program
2016-03-03 15:03:16	fs0ciety	still laziness... lol
2016-03-03 15:03:34	beedz	haha
2016-03-03 15:03:38	fs0ciety	i'll admit if i can't be bothered learning a new workflow its purely down to laziness
2016-03-03 15:07:57	beedz	why would i change though?
2016-03-03 15:08:06	beedz	photoshop/illustrator are the standards
2016-03-03 15:08:15	beedz	and i can use them quite proficiently :)
2016-03-03 15:08:31	fs0ciety	to learn new things.. how do you think i got so good at linux :)
2016-03-03 15:09:48	beedz	learning linux etc is different :P
2016-03-03 15:09:59	fs0ciety	how so
2016-03-03 15:11:25	beedz	well.. i create music in cubase.. i know the ins and outs of it.. it took me a LONG time to learn everything, to ditch that and learn audacity or something for the sake of open source?
2016-03-03 15:11:30	beedz	thats just silly, not laziness :)
2016-03-03 15:11:58	fs0ciety	audacity and cubase is a real bad example
2016-03-03 15:12:04	fs0ciety	audacity is not a sequencer
2016-03-03 15:12:05	beedz	on the other hand.. if i wanted to scrap debian and install another distro like gentoo or something for knowledge, thats different
2016-03-03 15:12:24	beedz	well cubase and some open source daw then :)
2016-03-03 15:12:44	fs0ciety	not if you are security conscience and dont want microsoft knowing all your information
2016-03-03 15:13:11	beedz	i'm very security conscious haha
2016-03-03 15:13:19	fs0ciety	not if you use windows 10
2016-03-03 15:13:19	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-03 15:13:30	fs0ciety	http://ardour.org
2016-03-03 15:13:33	beedz	oh i've disabled everything
2016-03-03 15:13:41	fs0ciety	haha you really think that worked
2016-03-03 15:13:57	fs0ciety	every update that add new ips to talk to
2016-03-03 15:14:49	fs0ciety	its shit
2016-03-03 15:15:02	fs0ciety	i have it purely for steam and thats all i use it for
2016-03-03 15:15:21	beedz	yeah i just use my machine for gaming really
2016-03-03 15:15:27	fs0ciety	windows 10 is literally malware
2016-03-03 15:15:44	beedz	i thought you liked it?
2016-03-03 15:15:56	beedz	oh man.. ardour doesnt even support vsts
2016-03-03 15:15:59	beedz	lol
2016-03-03 15:16:18	beedz	so I wouldn't even be able to use my 8k waves bundle
2016-03-03 15:16:21	fs0ciety	you do know a lot of vsts are built for linux now
2016-03-03 15:16:21	beedz	pointless :)
2016-03-03 15:16:42	fs0ciety	your pirated 8k waves bundle
2016-03-03 15:16:43	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-03 15:16:51	beedz	pfft
2016-03-03 15:16:53	beedz	of course
2016-03-03 15:16:58	beedz	i don't buy software!
2016-03-03 15:17:04	fs0ciety	i do these days
2016-03-03 15:17:07	fs0ciety	i used to not
2016-03-03 15:17:16	beedz	i buy games that are good
2016-03-03 15:17:28	beedz	$8,000 plugins, not so much
2016-03-03 15:17:34	fs0ciety	hahaha.. yeah
2016-03-03 15:17:49	fs0ciety	luckily i can get cubase using my gf *cough* educational price
2016-03-03 15:18:08	beedz	i really need to buy it
2016-03-03 15:18:14	beedz	DAW is something that is worth it
2016-03-03 15:18:23	beedz	even for the 600 buck pricetag
2016-03-03 15:18:26	fs0ciety	the updates alone are worth purchasing it
2016-03-03 15:19:44	beedz	i'm still using 5.1 cracked
2016-03-03 15:20:02	fs0ciety	so old.. the great thing about newer versions that take advantage of newer instruction sets
2016-03-03 15:20:05	beedz	which is fucked because i needed to use these new IK multimedia plugns which are 64bit
2016-03-03 15:20:13	fs0ciety	better memory management, and better threading
2016-03-03 15:20:22	beedz	took them 4000 manhours to crack that
2016-03-03 15:20:33	fs0ciety	reversing all the dongles calls yeah
2016-03-03 15:20:58	fs0ciety	but fucking hell, dongles are shit.. having to plug shit into your pc to use a piece of software
2016-03-03 15:24:56	beedz	indeed
2016-03-03 15:25:20	beedz	so... anymore thoughts about this forum? :)
2016-03-03 15:25:53	fs0ciety	not really. personally i'd like to fork that bbs software you were using and use modern protocols for file transfers
2016-03-03 15:25:58	beedz	how good would an rpg addon be.. with like xp per post etc haha (prob not) but cool idea, they have extensions for that
2016-03-03 15:26:11	fs0ciety	what was it called again
2016-03-03 15:26:19	beedz	mystic i think
2016-03-03 15:27:01	beedz	www.mysticbbs.com
2016-03-03 15:27:08	beedz	thats the leetest and neatest looking
2016-03-03 15:27:22	beedz	why bbs? pain in the ass hah
2016-03-03 15:28:11	fs0ciety	cause i prefer it.. great way for my friends who nag me for tv and movies all the time. make em use that and deal
2016-03-03 15:28:19	fs0ciety	so mystic actually supports ftp file transfer
2016-03-03 15:28:21	fs0ciety	go figure
2016-03-03 15:29:03	fs0ciety	and it uses python 2.7 to develop modifications.. interesting
2016-03-03 15:29:28	beedz	goodbye forum project haha
2016-03-03 15:29:30	beedz	;)
2016-03-03 15:29:50	fs0ciety	haha.. i've never really looked at this in detail
2016-03-03 15:30:24	beedz	i'm making the corners slightly rounded in the css at the moment
2016-03-03 15:30:26	fs0ciety	haha he needs to fix his website, click on forums goes to downloads
2016-03-03 15:31:47	beedz	daydream bbs was another one
2016-03-03 15:32:46	beedz	mystic looks better imo
2016-03-03 15:36:09	fs0ciety	https://github.com/NuSkooler/enigma-bbs
2016-03-03 15:39:05	beedz	enigma would be cool
2016-03-03 15:39:16	beedz	less hair pulling to make shit work
2016-03-03 15:39:24	fs0ciety	whats annoying about mystic - no bloody 64bit build
2016-03-03 15:39:30	beedz	and you'd be comfortable with your nodejs
2016-03-03 15:39:44	fs0ciety	nodejs is easy
2016-03-03 15:40:43	fs0ciety	why on earth would he only have 32bit builds is beyond me
2016-03-03 15:41:14	fs0ciety	is there a manual for mystic
2016-03-03 15:45:59	beedz	they did have a channel on here
2016-03-03 15:46:21	beedz	there was one guy who helped me a lot but forgot his nick
2016-03-03 15:47:48	beedz	use the telnet bbs list and check out all the mystic ones

2016-03-03 17:17:13	fs0ciety	at work its a bit difficult

2016-03-03 17:37:25	beedz	you're in front of a computer all day... multi-task :P
2016-03-03 17:46:28	beedz	hometime! ttyl

2016-03-08 11:07:01	beedz	Amstrad PC1512-2y  FTW
2016-03-08 11:07:20	fs0ciety	over the past few weeks i've become friends with a lot of demoscene people
2016-03-08 11:07:25	fs0ciety	kind of randomly happened
2016-03-08 11:07:28	fs0ciety	most peeps from poland
2016-03-08 11:09:54	beedz	how does that randomly happen? haha
2016-03-08 11:11:13	fs0ciety	i sit in an obscure irc server called unixchat. and there is only one channel on it
2016-03-08 11:11:18	fs0ciety	called #nixers
2016-03-08 11:11:18	fs0ciety	haha
2016-03-08 11:11:57	fs0ciety	it is essentially an irc channel for people who make ridiculous minimal desktop environments in linux
2016-03-08 11:11:59	fs0ciety	like mine
2016-03-08 11:27:56	fs0ciety	https://github.com/rewtnull/amigafonts
2016-03-08 12:11:08	beedz	nice! heh all daydream bbses
2016-03-08 12:30:55	fs0ciety	haha yeah
2016-03-08 14:00:49	beedz	just picked up the division yay
2016-03-08 14:01:10	beedz	first game ive got for ps4 in ages.. got it as my mates are playing.. bit of fun
2016-03-08 14:09:01	fs0ciety	haha.. well, well.. i made my terminal windows all amiga.
2016-03-08 14:09:02	fs0ciety	https://u.teknik.io/xlg9u.png
2016-03-08 15:23:48	fs0ciety	we should go really old school and setup a gopher server
2016-03-09 10:08:32	beedz	how good are amiga fonts
2016-03-09 10:08:34	beedz	leet as
2016-03-09 10:08:51	beedz	that shroom.ms bbs had all those fonts, looked awesome
2016-03-09 10:10:33	fs0ciety	yeah dude. The MicroKnight font is awesome, it is unfortunate it isn't unicode though
2016-03-09 10:10:45	fs0ciety	I wish I could get it smaller though :(
2016-03-09 10:11:10	fs0ciety	Size 16 on my 2k monitor - just a little too big
2016-03-09 11:11:27	beedz	ahh yeah :( might look a little weird with such hi-res
2016-03-09 11:15:33	fs0ciety	just.. big
2016-03-09 11:18:47	beedz	how would I go about changing my weechat font to an amiga font?
2016-03-09 11:19:03	beedz	and as i'm using it through putty will it still show?
2016-03-09 11:28:50	fs0ciety	you cant specifically do that in weechat, if you are using putty you would have to install the amiga font on your windows machine and change it in the putty settings
2016-03-09 11:30:27	beedz	i thought I might just do that in putty. Sweet
2016-03-09 11:33:36	beedz	l33t
2016-03-09 11:35:11	fs0ciety	screenshot me
2016-03-09 11:38:35	beedz	http://mar.imghost.us/dS8v.png

2016-03-09 11:42:02	fs0ciety	ahh so no amiga then
2016-03-09 11:42:14	beedz	this looked better at this size
2016-03-09 11:42:20	beedz	very similar
2016-03-09 11:42:29	fs0ciety	doesn't even look close.. look at this
2016-03-09 11:43:14	fs0ciety	https://u.teknik.io/nm8Ql.png
2016-03-09 11:43:43	beedz	oh yeah
2016-03-09 11:43:50	beedz	can tell with the 'O's
2016-03-09 11:44:02	beedz	what one is that?
2016-03-09 11:44:05	fs0ciety	MicroKnight
2016-03-09 11:44:10	fs0ciety	from amigafonts github
2016-03-09 11:44:29	beedz	sweet, i'll try that
2016-03-09 11:47:04	beedz	ah dang.. putty doesnt like it (doesnt show up after installing)
2016-03-09 11:47:12	fs0ciety	use the fon file
2016-03-09 11:52:28	beedz	word
2016-03-09 11:53:17	beedz	nope
2016-03-09 11:53:33	beedz	thats strange.. most of the other fonts worked 
2016-03-09 11:53:39	beedz	ttf
2016-03-09 11:54:16	fs0ciety	try size 16
2016-03-09 11:54:18	fs0ciety	see how that goes
2016-03-09 11:54:48	beedz	microknight doesn't like me
2016-03-09 11:55:23	fs0ciety	guess you ain't l33t
2016-03-09 11:55:24	fs0ciety	lol
2016-03-09 12:00:30	beedz	hahaha
2016-03-09 15:01:23	fs0ciety	wow so many shit reviews for the division
2016-03-09 15:01:28	fs0ciety	a boring grind fest most people call it
2016-03-09 17:05:28	beedz	yeah.. people succumb to the hype, and their expectations become too high. It's boring playing alone but with mates it's awesome fun
2016-03-09 17:06:11	beedz	once you hit high-level and have decent gear i can see it becoming repetative though
2016-03-09 17:06:45	beedz	i like shooting guns, and this game has lots of them with a heap of attachments and nice shooting mechanics so i'm happy :)
2016-03-09 18:48:49	 - 	irc: disconnected from server
2016-03-10 15:20:58	beedz	hows ya bbs going? :)
