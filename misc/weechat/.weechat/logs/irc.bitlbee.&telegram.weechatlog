2016-03-16 07:22:44	@root	You can create two kinds of channels. Control channels, and groupchat channels. By default, BitlBee will set up new channels as control channels if their name starts with an &, and as chat channels if it starts with a #.
2016-03-16 07:22:44	@root	 
2016-03-16 07:22:44	@root	Control channels are where you see your contacts. By default, you will have one control channel called &bitlbee, containing all your contacts. But you can create more, if you want, and divide your contact list accross several channels.
2016-03-16 07:22:44	@root	 
2016-03-16 07:22:44	@root	For example, you can have one channel with all contacts from your MSN Messenger account in it. Or all contacts from the group called "Work".

2016-03-16 07:22:54	@fsociety	help channels2
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	When you create a new channel, BitlBee will try to guess from its name which contacts to fill it with. For example, if the channel name (excluding the &) matches the name of a group in which you have one or more contacts, the channel will contain all those contacts.
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	 
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	Any valid account ID (so a number, protocol name or part of screenname, as long as it's unique) can also be used as a channel name. So if you just join &msn, it will contain all your MSN contacts. And if you have a Facebook account set up, you can see its contacts by just joining &facebook.
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	 
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	To start a simple group chat, you simply join a channel which a name starting with #, and invite people into it. All people you invite have to be on the same IM network and contact list.
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	 
2016-03-16 07:22:54	@root	If you want to configure your own channels, you can use the channel set command. See help channels3 for more information.
