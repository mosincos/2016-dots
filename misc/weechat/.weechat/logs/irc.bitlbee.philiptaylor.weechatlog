2016-03-30 13:33:54	fsociety	on saying that, they are making a taken tv series - unfortunately its like a precursor to the main character. so no one is being taken

2016-03-30 14:02:01	fsociety	i will say this about 32gb of ram - make sure your mobo likes to play friendly with that much ram. some mobos can be a bit buggy
2016-03-30 14:02:04	fsociety	so i'd do some research
2016-03-30 14:02:59	PhilipTaylor	least tick has the same writer... still interested to see where they take it
2016-03-30 14:03:17	fsociety	i predict you'll last two episodes

2016-03-30 14:09:39	fsociety	i was pretty pissed when david hayter wasn't in the new metal gear solid game
2016-03-30 14:09:48	fsociety	to the point i can say i dislike the game quite a lot
2016-03-30 14:10:00	fsociety	and i'm a metal gear solid fanboy
2016-03-30 14:10:13	fsociety	but remove a long standing actor from something and it just doesn't feel the same
2016-03-30 14:14:40	PhilipTaylor	did he play snake?
2016-03-30 14:15:11	fsociety	correct
2016-03-30 14:15:32	fsociety	then was an article posted in the last day or so saying he would never work with hideo kojima ever again
2016-03-30 14:15:40	PhilipTaylor	it was fun having ssnake in smash bros.. such a weird place for him too ewnd up
2016-03-30 14:15:53	fsociety	it was all due to metal gear twin snakes

2016-03-30 14:16:09	fsociety	which i have yet to complete
2016-03-30 14:16:17	fsociety	runs fine on dolphin with widescreen hacks
2016-03-30 14:17:09	fsociety	i'd use the dolphin emu a lot more if there were more decent games. haha

2016-03-30 14:28:08	fsociety	my biggest issue with nintendo games is the lack thereof regarding plot and story

2016-03-30 15:17:18	fsociety	haha just a tad
2016-03-30 15:17:40	fsociety	everybody who would want to watch the show would already have it
2016-03-30 15:17:52	fsociety	only reason being is look at the demographic the show is targetted to

2016-04-11 11:05:57	PhilipTaylor	nah feeling very well rested, just a bit clogged up still.. slept sooo much heheh even when I did get up, I would go watch telly and fall asleep on the couch

2016-04-11 13:11:09	PhilipTaylor	Man ue4 is fun... u so gotta get into it with us... there's so much more I can show you now - it's quite easy to make all kinds of shit happen... I find it as much fun as playing actual games
2016-04-11 13:33:13	fsociety	i think you find it as fun because you are good at 3d. where as i dont draw
2016-04-11 13:33:13		[13:33]
2016-04-11 13:33:49	fsociety	so all my concepts in my head always require to delve into 3d creation. and personally i have no interest in it "learning to make 3d models".
2016-04-11 13:39:00		[13:33]
2016-04-11 15:44:41	PhilipTaylor	lol I can understand that.. tho just making the engine do stuff is hella fun.. last night I just ran around shooting physics balls into piles until the engine crashed heheh
2016-04-11 15:44:41		[15:44]
2016-04-11 15:46:45	fsociety	all i've been doing today is reading a thesis on the xeno-series of games. its taken me nearly all day to read it. i knew this xeno series of games was complicated, but this just put it in a whole new ballpark
2016-04-11 15:47:02	fsociety	xenogears, xenosaga 1,2 and 3, xenoblade and xenoblade chronicles x
2016-04-11 15:51:00	fsociety	slow work day :)

2016-04-14 11:30:16	fsociety	currently at 44gb of 72.6gb - downloading on average at 210kb/s

2016-04-14 11:32:13	PhilipTaylor	we're really only one more gen away from realism finally
2016-04-14 11:32:27	fsociety	its the closest thing i've seen to realtime 3d imitating nearly life like models
2016-04-14 11:32:53	PhilipTaylor	it looks better than rendered movies from 5 years ago jeezus
2016-04-14 11:33:35	fsociety	haha.. yeah my linux sysadmin workmate showed it to me. initially i was going to ignore this because of the windows app store thing. but once he showed it to me i responded "I NEEEEED THIS NOW"

2016-04-14 11:36:15	fsociety	thats a game made in 2003
2016-04-14 11:36:16	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 11:37:29	PhilipTaylor	hahah it's so much fuin making old games look better hey... I've been playing old gamecube mario kart tracks in unreal for the same reason
2016-04-14 11:37:54	PhilipTaylor	and yyeah that screenshot looks pretty fuckin good
2016-04-14 11:38:20	fsociety	haha.. that game xenosaga is probably one of the best looking games on the console. it is also the most cpu/gpu consuming game on the emulator
2016-04-14 11:38:27	fsociety	feels good to know i can play it at 60fps at 2k
2016-04-14 11:38:36	fsociety	a year ago it would even run at 60fps at 1080p
2016-04-14 11:39:30	PhilipTaylor	hahah ahh the joysd of sli!
2016-04-14 11:40:28	fsociety	it doesn't support sli
2016-04-14 11:40:32	fsociety	neither does dolphin
2016-04-14 11:40:40	fsociety	just the internal code got better :)
2016-04-14 11:40:52	fsociety	also the opengl plugin on that emulator outperforms the directx one. haha
2016-04-14 11:41:03	fsociety	been up to anything other than work?
2016-04-14 11:46:42	PhilipTaylor	lol I guerss most emus don't really need to support sli... still. 300 fps woo
2016-04-14 11:46:42		[11:46]
2016-04-14 11:46:42	PhilipTaylor	 
2016-04-14 11:46:42	PhilipTaylor	nah not really, justr been sick n sleeping when not workin.. finally feeling better tho!
2016-04-14 11:46:42	PhilipTaylor	Having lots of fun with ue4.. know it a lot more these days
2016-04-14 11:47:09	fsociety	thats great, will you indulge in any middleware down the track?
2016-04-14 11:53:00		[11:47]
2016-04-14 11:58:02	PhilipTaylor	hmm such as?
2016-04-14 11:59:53	fsociety	hmmm... that is a good question..
2016-04-14 12:00:03	fsociety	haha im actually looking it up cause i know a lot of stuff is already integrated
2016-04-14 12:00:28	fsociety	has vulkan support been integrated into the latest unreal4 build yet. i haven't updated
2016-04-14 12:00:51	PhilipTaylor	yeah they've been really pushing to inteegrate everything so they can continue to release the engine for free... thinking of subbing to speedtree, nbut that's all I know of
2016-04-14 12:01:56	fsociety	that is fair enough
2016-04-14 12:02:23	fsociety	i want to remake an old hideo kojimo game called Snatchers.  Reaaaally easy to remake.. but I'd kinda need your help
2016-04-14 12:02:27	fsociety	I'll show you a video of the original game
2016-04-14 12:03:07	fsociety	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlpALaCCj2A
2016-04-14 12:03:40	fsociety	cause its so old, i was thinking making it less visual novel and more interactive.
2016-04-14 12:03:50	fsociety	i've already ripped all the audio and speech
2016-04-14 12:03:56	fsociety	even have the whole script as a text file
2016-04-14 12:04:58	PhilipTaylor	lol watchin now...
2016-04-14 12:04:58	PhilipTaylor	btw what ewver happened to your noir game? I'm sure we could make that happen
2016-04-14 12:05:49	PhilipTaylor	got the hang of making characters so you ccould easily replace your actors with 3d and use all your original backgrounds/scenes
2016-04-14 12:06:23	fsociety	JUST LISTEN TO THE MUSIC IN THAT INTRO
2016-04-14 12:06:28	fsociety	it will sell it to you :P
2016-04-14 12:06:33	PhilipTaylor	I am and I like
2016-04-14 12:06:36	fsociety	think the ghostbusters 2 theme song
2016-04-14 12:06:37	fsociety	lol
2016-04-14 12:06:39	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 12:06:42	fsociety	it always reminds me of that
2016-04-14 12:07:11	fsociety	the game is essentially if you mushed blade runner and terminator together
2016-04-14 12:07:11	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 12:07:59	PhilipTaylor	it's def a game that deserves a ramke hehe
2016-04-14 12:08:05	PhilipTaylor	remake even
2016-04-14 12:08:05		[12:08]
2016-04-14 12:08:17	fsociety	it was hideo kojimas first full game
2016-04-14 12:08:19	fsociety	metal gear solid
2016-04-14 12:08:37	fsociety	the voice actor who does the main character seems to channel get smart
2016-04-14 12:08:38	fsociety	hahaha
2016-04-14 12:08:59	fsociety	it would be pretty easy to recreate because it has such simple mechanics
2016-04-14 12:10:34	fsociety	and you could make it 3d if you wanted to :)
2016-04-14 12:10:51	fsociety	do your look around the room trick which you created eons ago
2016-04-14 12:11:40	fsociety	the game is also fairly small. only about 5 hours gameplay total
2016-04-14 12:12:09	fsociety	so it would be pretty easy in that area as well. the fact the whole design document is done. its just putting the puzzle pieces together :)
2016-04-14 12:12:29	PhilipTaylor	lol it's a pity we don't own the ip tho  :-P
2016-04-14 12:12:50	PhilipTaylor	what about your noir game? I still reckon that needs finishin
2016-04-14 12:13:49	fsociety	indeed
2016-04-14 12:14:16	fsociety	but snatcher is easier - and if i never mention the game till i actually push it out onto the net i'll be fine :)
2016-04-14 12:14:36	fsociety	i don't think konami give a rats ass about snatcher - or the general video game industry atm
2016-04-14 12:14:50	fsociety	at least hideo enjoys fan recreations
2016-04-14 12:14:58	fsociety	for eg. he let a metal gear solid fan film be released
2016-04-14 12:15:31	fsociety	.
2016-04-14 12:15:31	fsociety	comment text
2016-04-14 12:15:40	fsociety	goddamn it cut and paste

2016-04-14 12:27:05	PhilipTaylor	lol no more water? just too annoying?
2016-04-14 12:28:17	fsociety	oh i just keep looking at it and thinking - one day something is gonna fail
2016-04-14 12:28:46	fsociety	on a side note our power went out all morning yesterday. i was sick in bed.. meg had no idea what to do.  i woke up and discovered the toaster shorted the whole house. haha
2016-04-14 12:28:49	fsociety	replace toaster
2016-04-14 12:32:46	PhilipTaylor	ahahah it's always so annoying when it's somethin like the damn toaster! rofl
2016-04-14 12:32:46	PhilipTaylor	And yeah, would be no fun to come home one day to find out your pc had bled out hahaha
2016-04-14 12:33:18	fsociety	yeah cause even if there is a leak, thats a lot of up-to-date hardware destroyed
2016-04-14 12:33:41	fsociety	even though i haven't "upgraded" in 2 1/2 years - its still top of the line
2016-04-14 12:33:45	fsociety	that actually amuses me greatly
2016-04-14 12:33:57	fsociety	kind of grateful for that actually
2016-04-14 12:37:13	PhilipTaylor	ahahah yeah it's good in that you don'[t have to waste more money on hardware, but bad because COME ONE MOTHERFUCKERS I WANNA WASTE MORE MONEY
2016-04-14 12:37:13		[12:37]
2016-04-14 12:37:51	fsociety	haha yeah. i think i wasted enough money on this monitor and sli
2016-04-14 12:37:58	fsociety	did you get 32gb of ram yet?
2016-04-14 12:37:58	PhilipTaylor	lol did you see the whole butt shot thing ppl were complaining to blizzard abvout and they removed?
2016-04-14 12:38:10	PhilipTaylor	oh lol forgot.. should go do that
2016-04-14 12:38:34	fsociety	ill see if i can tell you what ram sticks i have
2016-04-14 12:38:39	fsociety	gimme a sec, since we have the same cpu
2016-04-14 12:42:45	fsociety	http://gskill.com/en/product/f3-1866c10q-32gxl
2016-04-14 12:42:58	fsociety	damn sturdy ram, not once did i have an issue with it
2016-04-14 12:43:18	fsociety	you could probably go for the 2133 32gb pack, but that wasn't around when i bought this
2016-04-14 12:43:22	fsociety	this is only 1866mhz
2016-04-14 12:43:33	fsociety	but the speed notice is so damn neglible, you wouldn't see it in any real world test
2016-04-14 12:43:42	PhilipTaylor	lol my current is only 1333
2016-04-14 12:44:03	fsociety	lets see if msy still sell it
2016-04-14 12:44:34	fsociety	they sell the 1600mhz version still
2016-04-14 12:44:51	fsociety	you'd have to buy two 16gb packs
2016-04-14 12:44:53	fsociety	$196 all up
2016-04-14 12:44:59	fsociety	thats pretty cheap for 32gb of ram
2016-04-14 12:45:02	fsociety	i remember paying like $300
2016-04-14 12:45:45	PhilipTaylor	that's not too bad, will go out n get some tomorrow  =)
2016-04-14 12:46:13	fsociety	found cheaper
2016-04-14 12:46:19	fsociety	cplonline do actually 32gb packs
2016-04-14 12:46:27	fsociety	and faster ram as well
2016-04-14 12:46:34	fsociety	http://cplonline.com.au/memory/ddr3-1866-32gb-4x8g-ripjawsz-f3-14900cl10q-32gbzl.html
2016-04-14 12:46:58	fsociety	http://cplonline.com.au/memory/g-skill-ddr3-1866-32gb-ares-f3-1866c10q-32gab.html
2016-04-14 12:47:09	fsociety	id go the cpl route :)
2016-04-14 12:47:20	fsociety	$259 compared to $298
2016-04-14 12:47:27	PhilipTaylor	why is 32 still the goddamn limit.. wish I could just use a whole ssd as ram
2016-04-14 12:47:35	fsociety	its not on skylake
2016-04-14 12:47:42	fsociety	on skylake you can get 64gb packs
2016-04-14 12:47:43	fsociety	for eg,
2016-04-14 12:47:56	fsociety	http://cplonline.com.au/corsair-64gb-4x16g-cmk64gx4m4a2133c13-ddr4-2133mhz-vengeance-lpx-black.html
2016-04-14 12:47:58	PhilipTaylor	wtf is skylake
2016-04-14 12:48:00	fsociety	one benefit in upgrading
2016-04-14 12:48:03	fsociety	the new intel cpu architecture
2016-04-14 12:48:07	fsociety	the latest i7s
2016-04-14 12:48:13	fsociety	that use ddr4
2016-04-14 12:48:27	fsociety	but look at price jump from 32gb to 64gb
2016-04-14 12:48:28	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 12:48:38	PhilipTaylor	lol buys*
2016-04-14 12:48:41	fsociety	i haven't upgraded to it because its 10% faster than my current cpu
2016-04-14 12:48:48	fsociety	want at least 30%
2016-04-14 12:48:56	PhilipTaylor	it's alright work will pay for it
2016-04-14 12:49:01	fsociety	also ddr4 is dropping in price quite rappidly
2016-04-14 12:49:03	fsociety	rapidly
2016-04-14 12:49:18	fsociety	get your work to buy me a new skylake then
2016-04-14 12:49:19	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 12:49:33	fsociety	say i do "....programming logic"
2016-04-14 12:49:36	PhilipTaylor	if you learned ue4 I would give you a job
2016-04-14 12:49:44	PhilipTaylor	seriously
2016-04-14 12:49:46	fsociety	give me a few weeks
2016-04-14 12:49:55	fsociety	i'll start getting nitty gritty with it on the weekend
2016-04-14 12:49:58	fsociety	wont take me long
2016-04-14 12:50:06	fsociety	its me after all..
2016-04-14 12:50:15	fsociety	i should stop stroking my ego
2016-04-14 12:50:35	fsociety	what would this job entail exactly?
2016-04-14 12:51:09	fsociety	cause now that you mention now i am keen :)
2016-04-14 12:51:13	PhilipTaylor	after my next meeting we will be looking to get more ppl on most likely - a 3d artist and someone to do blueprints and general ue4 shit.. if u come over some day soon I can run you through all kinds of shit I've learned
2016-04-14 12:51:41	fsociety	i can come over whenever you want me schnookums
2016-04-14 12:51:47	fsociety	i do only live 5 minutes away
2016-04-14 12:51:49	PhilipTaylor	hahahah
2016-04-14 12:52:10	fsociety	this evening, or late this arvo
2016-04-14 12:53:16	PhilipTaylor	yeah cool, my uncle is coming over to check up how things are going, could be good to poop by then... 
2016-04-14 12:53:16		[12:53]
2016-04-14 12:53:36	fsociety	what specific time would suit you then?
2016-04-14 12:54:12	PhilipTaylor	at the moment one really useful thing would be makingg more vehicles do things like crans arms moving etc.. there's no 3d to do, just manipulatiing already imported things
2016-04-14 12:54:41	fsociety	if theres anything i cooould do is make ridiculously intricate blueprints
2016-04-14 12:54:53	fsociety	or if there is something you cant do in blueprints i could write it in c++
2016-04-14 12:55:19	PhilipTaylor	well he will be by 6-7ish.. perhaps pop by round 5 if u like n we can chat about shit.. but yeah there's a good chance I will have enough work for you.. btw how much you get paid currently if u don't mind me asking?
2016-04-14 12:55:39	fsociety	not that much
2016-04-14 12:55:42	fsociety	only $55,000
2016-04-14 12:55:49	fsociety	been meaning to get out of my job.. but its so cushy
2016-04-14 12:56:15	fsociety	i should be getting paid a lot more
2016-04-14 12:56:21	fsociety	but small business syndrome
2016-04-14 12:56:24	PhilipTaylor	well I might have somethin way for fun for you then  :-P hahah
2016-04-14 12:56:27	fsociety	and i guess its like family
2016-04-14 12:56:34	fsociety	hahahaha
2016-04-14 12:56:42	fsociety	well at least i get shit done :P
2016-04-14 12:57:53	PhilipTaylor	here's one tute I did, it's very much the sort of thing we will be doing a lot of... I already have it working but it's definitely worth following - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR0fH6O9jD8
2016-04-14 12:58:10	fsociety	if you could make a quick txt file of all the "good" tuts that would be nice
2016-04-14 12:58:23	PhilipTaylor	explains a lot of other minor shsit as it goes, found it quite useful
2016-04-14 12:58:44	PhilipTaylor	yeah cool, actually setting up a trello board for exactly that purpose
2016-04-14 12:59:02	fsociety	at least my pc has come prepared. haha
2016-04-14 12:59:22	fsociety	constantly testing your projects in 21:9... haha
2016-04-14 13:00:37	PhilipTaylor	oh one other really useful thing I could get you to focus on is matinee, it's pretty much afx animating in ue4, so I think ytou could pick it up pretty quick - oh and AI - if you were to become an ai master the work for you would never end
2016-04-14 13:01:18	fsociety	i already know how to use AI
2016-04-14 13:01:22	fsociety	i use it for work all the time
2016-04-14 13:01:27	fsociety	and for my own game stuff
2016-04-14 13:01:39	fsociety	as for matinee, i had a quick look at it - its very AFX - keyframes and all
2016-04-14 13:01:50	PhilipTaylor	know much about how ue4 handles it?
2016-04-14 13:01:57	PhilipTaylor	ai I mean?
2016-04-14 13:02:00	PhilipTaylor	brb btw
2016-04-14 13:02:21	fsociety	not specifically with ue4
2016-04-14 13:02:43	fsociety	but wouldn't be hard to pick up i'd imagine consdering there is a big layer of "its already done for you" fluff
2016-04-14 13:04:35	PhilipTaylor	yeah sure is... if you wanna know where to start, this is a good place... there's a few thingss they leave out of the explanation tho, pay close attention to the values in the bluepprint screenshots.. both dan and I were pulling out hair out because we missed like 2 variables values
2016-04-14 13:04:35	PhilipTaylor	https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart/
2016-04-14 13:05:00	fsociety	haha.. that probably comes from not being anal retentive programmers
2016-04-14 13:05:18	fsociety	i always keep a special list of variables in close vicinity so i dont fuck things up like that
2016-04-14 13:05:34	fsociety	as i said earlier make me a txt file and i'll go through..
2016-04-14 13:05:41	fsociety	right now im catching up on mundane work shit
2016-04-14 13:09:09	fsociety	and updating megs teaching website, she is so awful at keeping websites up-to-date.. the longer she leaves it the more likely it will be hacked
2016-04-14 13:09:09		[13:09]
2016-04-14 13:16:17	PhilipTaylor	yeah cool, didn't mean jump right in this second hahaha
2016-04-14 13:16:17	PhilipTaylor	I will set up a trello board now
2016-04-14 13:16:17	PhilipTaylor	 
2016-04-14 13:16:17	PhilipTaylor	but yeah, if all goes well at the next meeting, should easily have enough work to keep you busy if ya want it
2016-04-14 13:16:34	fsociety	im always up for something that isn't dealing with mainframes
2016-04-14 13:16:50	fsociety	and as you've figured out i have pretty consistent work ethic
2016-04-14 13:18:20	fsociety	updating megs website. i'd forgotten what redirection i put in to hide people from hacking it.  realise i put it as criticalcompass.com/nothingtosee
2016-04-14 13:18:20	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 13:18:38	fsociety	also i'd forgotten megs login credentials, so i just hacked her user database.. sorry meg
2016-04-14 13:18:55	fsociety	her fault for not doing this more regularly
2016-04-14 13:19:41	PhilipTaylor	hahaha
2016-04-14 13:20:09	PhilipTaylor	btw set yourself up a trello account and I will add you to this board...
2016-04-14 13:20:09	PhilipTaylor	trello.com
2016-04-14 13:21:44	fsociety	ok i'll do that now
2016-04-14 13:23:41	PhilipTaylor	btw happy to pick u up later
2016-04-14 13:28:00	fsociety	that would be nice, im not feeling 100%, but it would be good to catch up
2016-04-14 13:28:00		[13:28]
2016-04-14 13:31:27	fsociety	created an account at trello

2016-04-14 14:30:16		[14:30]
2016-04-14 14:41:50	fsociety	its all good
2016-04-14 14:42:05	fsociety	at least you convinced me to sit on gchat .. humph.. grumble.. pfft
2016-04-14 14:42:34	PhilipTaylor	hahaha are other people talking to you more now too?
2016-04-14 14:48:00		[14:42]
2016-04-14 14:59:15	fsociety	nope
2016-04-14 14:59:19	fsociety	just you and rarely dan
2016-04-14 14:59:36	fsociety	its all combined into my irc chat window anyway.. so really i dont know the different between whatever protocol
2016-04-14 14:59:47	fsociety	i have been using telegram a lot lately, you'd like that chat protocol
2016-04-14 14:59:59	fsociety	ability to integrate youtube videos inside the chat window
2016-04-14 15:00:00	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 15:00:21	PhilipTaylor	oh lo lso it just shows up in your irc? makes life easy!
2016-04-14 15:02:55	fsociety	yeah
2016-04-14 15:03:16	fsociety	everything does - gchat, telegram, steam chat, and whatever else i want
2016-04-14 15:03:16		[15:03]
2016-04-14 15:03:25	fsociety	there is a twitter window as well which i don't look at very often
2016-04-14 15:03:31	fsociety	the steam chat window in irc is handy at times
2016-04-14 15:09:00		[15:03]
2016-04-14 15:09:40	fsociety	brb going into windows mode
2016-04-14 15:09:40	fsociety	haha
2016-04-14 15:09:53		irc: disconnected from server
2016-04-14 15:24:27	fsociety	and back
2016-04-14 15:24:27		[15:24]
2016-04-14 15:24:41	fsociety	was testing out ps2 plugins.. seeing the visual differences between directx 9,10,11 and opengl
2016-04-14 15:25:00	PhilipTaylor	much difference?
2016-04-14 15:26:47	fsociety	yeah directx doesn't deal with ps2 faux depth of field and bloom very well
2016-04-14 15:27:10	fsociety	remember how the ps2 used to do that real fuzzy visually to emulate depth of field and to counteract the shittiness of crt/tube tvs
2016-04-14 15:27:48	fsociety	opengl is able to do the calculations properly and create these fx. directx not so successfull. more artifacts and weird colour changes
2016-04-14 15:28:01	fsociety	just saw the ue tutorials -- thanks for that
2016-04-14 15:31:06	fsociety	I created a user on my localised git repository so you can see the idea of it
2016-04-14 15:31:12	fsociety	https://mkfs.io/git
2016-04-14 15:31:18	fsociety	username: phil
2016-04-14 15:31:23	fsociety	password: philtaylor
2016-04-14 15:31:30	fsociety	change it to whatever you want
2016-04-14 15:31:52	PhilipTaylor	cool will take a look in a sec, just trying to work something out  =)
2016-04-14 15:32:07	fsociety	no probs
2016-04-14 15:32:29	fsociety	it also doubles as a bug tracker, so if someone finds a bug they raise a ticket and assign etc.
2016-04-14 15:38:00		[15:32]
2016-04-14 15:48:13	PhilipTaylor	yeah I've used similar things before, happy to give it a go at some point  =)
2016-04-14 15:49:28	fsociety	well the great thing about it - you can go back and forth commits, so if you do a really big screw up.. you back a few commits
2016-04-14 15:49:36	fsociety	i'll show you how it works when i see you
2016-04-14 15:55:00		[15:49]
2016-04-14 16:00:04	fsociety	if you get bored this is pretty amusing.. the creator of linux is quite straight to the point. kind of refreshing

2016-04-15 09:45:41	fsociety	working with friends is always a dubious area, but i know i can work with you
2016-04-15 09:46:58	PhilipTaylor	hahah I'm sure we'll be fine  :-P I gotta get a maccas done today, but I should be able to prep some vehicles for you in the arvo - at the latest tomorrow mornin

2016-04-15 10:14:07	fsociety	well always knew they would do this
2016-04-15 10:15:04	fsociety	its a pretty easy choice.. go with a company that tries its hardest to invade your privacy or a company that tries to do the best thing by its customers
2016-04-15 10:15:26	fsociety	haha.. i wasn't sure what your uncle thought of me.. made me a bit unsure.. haha

2016-04-15 10:24:18	fsociety	Haha
2016-04-15 10:24:30	fsociety	looking at trello, i could create something more internal down the track
2016-04-15 10:24:41	fsociety	which is probably a wise move considering the information you are dealing with
2016-04-15 10:29:48	fsociety	i could probably for a console version of trello for my desktop actually
2016-04-15 10:30:41	PhilipTaylor	hahah you and your consoles heheh  :-P
2016-04-15 10:30:41	PhilipTaylor	yeah atm only using trello to store tutes etc, will use something else to manage work
2016-04-15 10:35:42	fsociety	jira is probably one of the most popular
2016-04-15 10:36:17	fsociety	especially for filing bugs, requests, etc.. you can then assign said task to whoever you need

2016-04-19 08:06:45	fsociety	morning
2016-04-19 08:06:45		[08:06]
2016-04-19 08:06:48		[PhilipTaylor] is away: Away
2016-04-19 08:12:00		[08:06]
2016-04-19 09:42:41	fsociety	raaaah
2016-04-19 09:42:41		[09:42]
2016-04-19 10:01:08	fsociety	still in bed?
2016-04-19 10:01:08		[10:01]
2016-04-19 10:06:27	PhilipTaylor	yaaawn heh yep
2016-04-19 10:12:00		[10:06]
2016-04-19 10:23:06	fsociety	im fucking roapable
2016-04-19 10:23:18	fsociety	one of the programmers at cca still considers me level 1 support
2016-04-19 10:29:00		[10:23]
2016-04-19 11:03:39	fsociety	anyway
2016-04-19 11:03:39		[11:03]
2016-04-19 11:54:19	PhilipTaylor	ahhh finally in front of pc heheh
2016-04-19 11:54:19		[11:54]
2016-04-19 11:55:45	fsociety	haha
2016-04-19 11:55:52	fsociety	hows life
2016-04-19 11:56:47	PhilipTaylor	eh not too bad.. meeting didn't go quite as well as we had hopes, wasn't bad but could have been better
2016-04-19 12:02:00		[11:56]
2016-04-19 12:02:30	fsociety	what happened?
2016-04-19 12:08:00		[12:02]
2016-04-19 12:18:33	PhilipTaylor	ahh from the start it became clear the boss who had approved a couple months dev time hadn't really done it the right way and had been chewed out for spending money... got a good idea of what they want now, it's just going to be simplified a lot more for the moment
2016-04-19 12:19:59	PhilipTaylor	they basically want to spend about half to a third of what we thought they did, mainly because the guy got told he had no extra budget
2016-04-19 12:21:08	fsociety	so how does this change the workflow, this would probably also limit the amount of people you hire also
2016-04-19 12:24:02	PhilipTaylor	yeah at this point it just means a much slower start... there will still be the need for other people just not so immediately. It also means we can shop the product round more... bit of a slow down to the whole process. Still well worth learning blueprints tho - there's another project with the MCG my uncle is currently attempting to pick up and that will involve a lot of AI
2016-04-19 12:24:02		[12:24]
2016-04-19 12:25:33	fsociety	ahh all good.. i will still learn what you gave me, was gonna do a big chunk tonight.. 
2016-04-19 12:28:55	fsociety	shame though about the meeting
2016-04-19 12:29:20	fsociety	im imagining a patrick batemen in the CEO chair
2016-04-19 12:29:31	fsociety	"as you can see my business card clearly looks better than yours" ;)
2016-04-19 12:32:20	PhilipTaylor	ahh it's still good, they're still planning on using it, just means simpler projects for the moment wehich isn't a bad thing.. was getting quite worn out trying to cram all the fancy  shit in there hahah
2016-04-19 12:32:20	PhilipTaylor	 
2016-04-19 12:32:20	PhilipTaylor	And yeah like I said this isn't the only company we've been talking to - all we need is a couple more takers which isn't far off... 
2016-04-19 12:33:37	PhilipTaylor	I wilkl add a bunch more tutes to trello soon - all the stuff about AI would probably be the best place to ficus attention ftm
2016-04-19 12:37:41	fsociety	so move away from bone rigging and move towards ai
2016-04-19 12:43:00		[12:37]
2016-04-19 12:43:25	PhilipTaylor	at this point yeah, it's all still going to be needed, but the most likey next steps will involve a lot more AI and it's quite a complex subject
2016-04-19 12:46:12	PhilipTaylor	I was thinking of throwing it all in and becoming a mirror inspector
2016-04-19 12:46:21	PhilipTaylor	Inspecting mirrors is a job I could easily see myself doing.
2016-04-19 12:46:28	PhilipTaylor	ba dum tiss hehe
2016-04-19 12:52:00		[12:46]

2016-04-19 12:59:00		[12:53]
2016-04-19 13:00:44	PhilipTaylor	you can always try it out with a template level with starter content... won't be too huge that way too  =)
2016-04-19 13:06:00		[13:00]
2016-04-19 13:06:11	fsociety	thats true. i'll set that up tonight

2016-04-21 12:14:42	fsociety	on saying that.. here is my inital thoughts on the wii u
2016-04-21 12:14:42		[12:14]
2016-04-21 12:14:50	fsociety	why, oh why is the menu system so slow?
2016-04-21 12:15:06	fsociety	also surround sound is weird on it.
2016-04-21 12:21:00		[12:15]
2016-04-21 12:28:26	PhilipTaylor	menu sys slow? what u mean?
2016-04-21 12:29:02	PhilipTaylor	not surprised about surround really, it is only a wiiu after all heheh
2016-04-21 12:35:00		[12:29]
2016-04-21 12:44:58	fsociety	guess what i just did
2016-04-21 12:45:00	fsociety	i bought a dreamcast
2016-04-21 12:45:01	fsociety	haha

2016-04-21 12:48:04	fsociety	haaaaa.. dreamcast is cooler
2016-04-21 12:54:00		[12:48]
2016-04-21 12:58:07	PhilipTaylor	lol think yer on yer own there haha 
2016-04-21 12:58:07	PhilipTaylor	why u want a dreamcast these days anyways?
2016-04-21 13:03:40	fsociety	shenmue
2016-04-21 13:03:44	fsociety	shenmue 2
2016-04-21 13:03:52	fsociety	there are no good working emulators for the system
2016-04-21 13:04:00	fsociety	and honestly i dont think im on my own regarding dc
2016-04-21 13:05:13	fsociety	http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dreamcast-a-forensic-retrospective-article
2016-04-21 13:05:28	fsociety	its my start to collecting old systems - or have you forgotten the need to do that yourself. haha
2016-04-21 13:07:19	PhilipTaylor	hehe yeah I got over that... I forgot you were gettin into it again tho hehe. I would be impressed if u got your hands ona 3DO
2016-04-21 13:09:26	fsociety	but there are no games i want to play on the 3DO
2016-04-21 13:09:26		[13:09]
2016-04-21 13:09:36	fsociety	also one reason I wanted the DC is the open source development kit you can use on it

2016-04-21 13:09:50	fsociety	and not the ps4/xbone

2016-04-22 10:07:49	fsociety	i enjoy doing video editing
2016-04-22 10:07:52	fsociety	always have
2016-04-22 10:08:13	fsociety	especially since i know the nitty gritty of codecs and how they work with B-frames, etc.
2016-04-22 10:09:19	fsociety	the person already sent the dreamcast out.
2016-04-22 10:09:21	fsociety	that was good
2016-04-22 10:09:32	fsociety	and i bought a vaporiser for meg yesterday, it came this morning to the door at 7am

2016-04-22 10:10:42	PhilipTaylor	 
2016-04-22 10:10:42	PhilipTaylor	hehe so she going to smell all fruity too now?
2016-04-22 10:10:52	fsociety	haha yeah
2016-04-22 10:11:29	fsociety	yeah.. my love of film never goes away.. its actually due to blade runner actually that i really got into film analysis and the technical element of it
2016-04-22 10:12:07	fsociety	so it was kind of fun.. cause the notes she gave me from the study guide gave no time stamp - just a roundabout place where to stop.  for example "stop scene when deckard gets to tyrell's building"
2016-04-22 10:12:22	fsociety	luckily i know the film really well. haha
2016-04-22 10:12:29	fsociety	how was your evening?
2016-04-22 10:15:39	PhilipTaylor	so you pretty much had to watch the movie to find the right spots? ahh joy hehe

2016-04-22 10:18:46	PhilipTaylor	yeah I said that to Dan towards the end of the night.. we were playing Lara Croft and the temple of Osiris - good multiplayer puzzle game... this one has up to 4 player local and when we realised my first thought was we gotta drag Dean round next time hehe
2016-04-22 10:20:26	fsociety	haha.. wooo. tomb raider
2016-04-22 10:20:36	fsociety	which reminds the new tomb raider gets released for linux next week..

2016-04-22 10:29:46	fsociety	and that game uses both of my gfx cards :)

2016-04-22 10:39:00	fsociety	and thats with ultra-gpu intensive msaa
2016-04-22 10:44:00		[10:39]
2016-04-22 10:54:57	PhilipTaylor	hehe I would like to see that some time if you still have it installed  :-P
2016-04-22 10:55:01	PhilipTaylor	btw
2016-04-22 10:55:02	PhilipTaylor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulcPZWW1jc8
2016-04-22 10:55:59	fsociety	sure
2016-04-22 10:56:01	fsociety	its still installed
2016-04-22 10:56:44	fsociety	i'd like to see the man in that video replaced with you
2016-04-22 10:56:45	fsociety	haha
2016-04-22 11:01:21	PhilipTaylor	lol I would need to add some pew pew lasers tho too
2016-04-22 11:01:21		[11:01]
2016-04-22 11:05:34	fsociety	so i thought as a bit of test in my sparetime, that segacd visual novel adventure game
2016-04-22 11:05:42	fsociety	i think it would seem only appropriate to do a remake on the dreamcast
2016-04-22 11:05:43	fsociety	haha
2016-04-22 11:05:57	PhilipTaylor	NNNEEEEERRRRRDDDD
2016-04-22 11:05:59	PhilipTaylor	hahaha
2016-04-22 11:06:01	fsociety	yeaaahhh
2016-04-22 11:06:07	fsociety	im really looking forward to coding on it
2016-04-22 11:06:17	PhilipTaylor	why don't u remake it on something that people might actually play haha
2016-04-22 11:07:16	PhilipTaylor	sorry for poopooing your dreamcast dreams haha
2016-04-22 11:07:58	PhilipTaylor	tho at least if u did it in ue4, all the skills you learn along the way could be useful tho  :-P
2016-04-22 11:08:33	fsociety	thats true.. i was considering that as well
2016-04-22 11:08:57	fsociety	on saying that if i do it in ue4, im gonna make it 3d and walk through the buildings etc
2016-04-22 11:09:03	fsociety	so that would require YOU
2016-04-22 11:09:07	fsociety	cause its 3d
2016-04-22 11:09:07	fsociety	lol
2016-04-22 11:11:15	PhilipTaylor	lol u just need to learn some super basic things about modelling to achieve what you want... but yeah would be happy to help here n there if it means you used ue4 instead heheh
2016-04-22 11:11:15	PhilipTaylor	 
2016-04-22 11:11:15	PhilipTaylor	I think my attitude just comes from my own fuckarounds with older systems.. I have put heaps of work hours and hours into mods that like 12 people ended up playing. I found it rather unsatisfying at the end of the day
2016-04-22 11:12:54	PhilipTaylor	remember my recreation of everything in Super Metroid up to the first boss?
2016-04-22 11:12:54	PhilipTaylor	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUEECReJJBg
2016-04-22 11:13:13	PhilipTaylor	was going to do the whole thing but not enough ppl played it
2016-04-22 11:17:38	fsociety	hahaha... yeah... personally for me.. i don't care if anyone plays.. always comes down to academic exercise.. i actually prefer not to tell anyone purely then people start nagging you and have expectations.  happened a few times when i put demos of my old games up.. IS IT OUT YET? WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE RELEASED? YOU WERE SUPPOSE TO RELEASE IT A MONTH AGO
2016-04-22 11:17:38		[11:17]
2016-04-22 11:28:46	PhilipTaylor	hahah yeah know what u mean.. nothing more annoying than 50 12 year olds hassling you every day
2016-04-22 11:29:07	fsociety	exactly
2016-04-22 11:29:29	fsociety	hows your bro doing, haven't heard from him in a while
2016-04-22 11:29:59	PhilipTaylor	lol he's been very busy with work lately, was just chatting to him via email a few mins ago actually

2016-04-22 12:14:24	fsociety	i'd been building up to that joke all day
2016-04-22 12:16:38	PhilipTaylor	man I think that's the best Prince joke we're going to hear... did you actually come up with it yourself?
2016-04-22 12:17:07	PhilipTaylor	it deserves a hearty African American OH NO HE DIENT
2016-04-22 12:17:12	fsociety	hahaha
