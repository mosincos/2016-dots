2016-03-08 11:28:59	fsociety	it means i dont have touch obscure unix machines.. the moment i have to sit down with aix the moment i pull my hair out

2016-03-08 11:29:50	fsociety	we actually have an instance of z/os running in hercules.  i know we shouldn't do it.. but fuck ibm
2016-03-08 11:30:01	skrzyp	someone said me they never fire you if you know z/os
2016-03-08 11:30:22	fsociety	pretty correct
2016-03-08 11:30:29	fsociety	its so obscure and odd as an OS
2016-03-08 11:30:53	fsociety	but very sought after as the industry refuses to train new recruits and its pretty complex as an OS
2016-03-08 11:30:58	fsociety	not what you'd call end user friendly
2016-03-08 11:31:17	skrzyp	I had account on z/OS mainframe
2016-03-08 11:31:24	skrzyp	but I dropped it because I can't use it
2016-03-08 11:31:52	skrzyp	but I have a large allowance for unusual OSes as I know AmigaOS, SpartaDOS and basics of VMS
2016-03-08 11:33:11	fsociety	if you can learn z/OS do so.. guarantedd high paying job in the backend mainframe infastructure
2016-03-08 11:33:29	fsociety	i only know its basics
2016-03-08 11:33:45	fsociety	only of the assembly coders here at work showed me enough to navigate through it
2016-03-08 11:33:50	fsociety	and hes pretty eccentric
2016-03-08 11:34:04	fsociety	refuses to work past 3pm .. says his brain refuses to function after that
2016-03-08 11:34:10	fsociety	has a ridiculously long white beard
2016-03-08 11:34:26	fsociety	walks around with only one lense in his glasses
2016-03-08 11:36:38	skrzyp	how can I get z/OS for education use?
2016-03-08 11:37:24	fsociety	i could send it to you ;)
2016-03-08 11:37:32	fsociety	otherwise it is impossible
2016-03-08 11:38:35	skrzyp	isn't that protected?
2016-03-08 11:38:46	skrzyp	I mean, you can send it to me, but I won't be able to install
2016-03-08 11:39:07	fsociety	*cough* yes protected
2016-03-08 11:39:10	fsociety	you need to install hercules
2016-03-08 11:39:17	fsociety	and you can install it without an issue
2016-03-08 11:40:36	skrzyp	I asked about some things like license protection
2016-03-08 11:40:47	skrzyp	you know, I think it might ask me about serial number
2016-03-08 11:40:55	fsociety	:)
2016-03-08 11:41:02	skrzyp	is that possible?
2016-03-08 11:41:09	fsociety	i can send you an installed instance which gets past that
2016-03-08 11:41:20	fsociety	because hercules can immitate cpuids
2016-03-08 11:41:36	fsociety	the thing is, the installed instance is 80gb
2016-03-08 11:41:38	fsociety	so it might take a bitr
2016-03-08 11:41:41	skrzyp	or "PLZ PUT YOUR DICK^WKEYDONGLE IN PORT 0 AND PRESS ANY KEY WHEN READY"
2016-03-08 11:41:42	fsociety	i can't type today
2016-03-08 11:41:53	fsociety	hahaha..
2016-03-08 11:42:04	fsociety	that would be an amusing copy protection scheme though
2016-03-08 11:42:13	fsociety	"WHAT DO U THINK A DONGLE IS.. PUT IT IN THERE"
2016-03-08 11:42:14	fsociety	lol
2016-03-08 11:42:21	skrzyp	like CUBASE did on ST/TT
2016-03-08 11:42:41	fsociety	CUBASE still do that
2016-03-08 11:43:01	fsociety	they never stopped that protection scheme
2016-03-08 11:44:11	skrzyp	do you know Calamus is still developed on ST/Falcon?
2016-03-08 11:45:18	fsociety	really
2016-03-08 11:45:21	fsociety	i need to check this out
2016-03-08 11:46:11	skrzyp	it's still proprietary, but loonks like old cracks still work
2016-03-08 11:47:48	fsociety	haha.. i can't believe its still being developed
2016-03-08 11:47:57	fsociety	how many ppl still use this application
2016-03-08 11:48:23	skrzyp	protip: many more than you can expect to
2016-03-08 11:49:03	fsociety	at least its something that isn't microsoft or adobe i guess
2016-03-08 11:49:43	skrzyp	that guy with f060 and hades still uses it
2016-03-08 11:49:50	skrzyp	he mainly uses f060 with MiNT for daily use
2016-03-08 11:50:10	skrzyp	his PC is basically an crappy laptop with half gig of RAM and windows XP
2016-03-08 11:50:20	fsociety	i can see the appeal
2016-03-08 11:50:22	fsociety	i really can
2016-03-08 11:50:59	skrzyp	there's another guy here who uses pentium4 with 512mb ram alongside atari xe and ste in the same time
2016-03-08 11:51:40	skrzyp	but the problem is that second admits his machine has 3GHZ CPU AND CAN'T SHOW YOUTUBE WITHOUT HANGING HURR DURR 
2016-03-08 11:52:08	skrzyp	( i repeat, it's single core pentium 4, oc'ed, still with half gig of ram, and firefox 44 )
2016-03-08 11:52:27	skrzyp	( and flash installed, youtube won't switch to html5 if you haven't disabled flash )
