2016-02-18 22:01:46	@degville	Devilment: I loved Boyhood. Found it very moving, despite not having much in common with the 'boy'. Watched The Revenant last night. 10/10 for effort. 4/10 for the film itself.
2016-02-18 22:02:20	fs0ciety	Something about Leo I just don't like
2016-02-18 22:02:26	fs0ciety	I think he tries that little bit too hard
2016-02-18 22:03:07	@degville	Yeah. I think he's well cast in Wolf of Wall Street. And also Django Unchained. Tom Hardy would have been better for the lead in The Revenant imo.
2016-02-18 22:04:51	fs0ciety	Hardy's great. Legend was awesome.. I kept putting on the voice of Ronnie for days
2016-02-18 22:05:16	fs0ciety	Walked around the house and speaking to my housemates like that. Haha they probably got irritated, but I amused myself :)
2016-02-18 22:06:41	fs0ciety	i'd imagine Hardy would be a big contender for the next Bond actually

2016-02-18 22:14:57	@degville	Yeah, I think you're right, unless he decline the potential stereotype. He's one of those actors who seems to actually act, rather than relying on the cliche of menace.

2016-02-18 23:28:57	Devilment	In Django Unchained, enforced method acting by Leo. He really did cut his hand on the glass
2016-02-18 23:29:36	Devilment	It's why the rest of the actors are looking at each other shiftedly
2016-02-18 23:30:00	Devilment	They were expecting QT to shout "Cut!" (No pun intended)

2016-02-18 23:31:15	Devilment	I wasn't a fan of Leo when I was younger, mainly because of the Titanic hype, but was won over by his performance in 'Catch Me If You Can'
2016-02-18 23:31:58	@degville	I felt the same. Didn't know about the hand... and yes, Catch Me If You Can is good.

2016-02-19 01:23:00	mcphail	I suspect this is all going to end in tears (or a bespoke licensing agreement between Canonical and Oracle)
2016-02-19 01:23:00		[01:23]
2016-02-19 01:24:21	popey	maybe such an agreement exists?
2016-02-19 01:25:22	mcphail	Got to hope so, although it would make me sad as it would make the Ubuntu kernel less free

2016-02-20 05:13:59	mcphail	popey: why not...!
2016-02-20 05:14:02	popey	 😃
2016-02-20 05:14:11	mcphail	http://insights.ubuntu.com/2016/02/18/zfs-licensing-and-linux/ - that is sailing pretty close to the wind. To state that a kernel object is not a derivative work of the kernel is _one_ interpretation
2016-02-20 05:16:53	mcphail	Now, my understanding is it is the GPL, rather than the CDDL, which forbids ZFS as a kernel module. Nvidia attempt to bypass this by providing a shim which the user compiles themselves between non-GPL compliant code and the kernel. Is there going to be a similar dkms'ed shim layer here?
2016-02-20 05:16:53		[05:16]
2016-02-20 05:18:33	mcphail	The google/oracle stushie already points to the header files falling under copyright (hence licence) of the original work, so using the kernel header files (to my mind) makes a module a derivative work
2016-02-20 05:21:04	*	mcphail thinks that even if Canonical are correct here, there FUD surrounding the issue is not going to attract business

2016-02-20 05:32:58		[05:32]
2016-02-20 05:33:25	mcphail	I don't know why Canonical do these things. It always causes so much of a distraction, and diverts them from more useful work.
2016-02-20 05:33:35	popey	these things?
2016-02-20 05:33:41	popey	What our customers ask for 😖
2016-02-20 05:34:11	mcphail	Actions which are questionable (at best) to the community.
2016-02-20 05:35:27	mcphail	It is particulary sad, because the future of ZFS in any context is becoming fuzzy. It isn't clear how much impetus Oracle are putting behind it
2016-02-20 05:36:20	mcphail	Technically, it is a good solution just now for certain cases. But growing/developing btrfs surely has to be the preferred option in the long run
2016-02-20 05:36:39	popey	we already have btrfs, it's been in ubuntu for aeons
2016-02-20 05:36:44	popey	but it's just not stable

2016-02-20 05:36:50	popey	Not a lot _we_ can do about that
2016-02-20 05:37:07	popey	I mean, SUSE have it as the default FS on their installs, but they have staff who work on btrfs (AIUI)
2016-02-20 05:37:26	popey	we don't have any btrfs skills in house (not that we have zfs skills AFAIK)
2016-02-20 05:38:03	popey	I love btrfs, but it seems the wider free software community has spoken and zfs is the annointed one
2016-02-20 05:38:56	mcphail	Well, I suspect this is going to be painful

2016-02-20 06:57:48	einonm	A $(prev employer) used to have a load of proprietary drivers released under the 'other-os-developed' GPL exception. It's a massive pain, as you can't use a lot of kernel functionality within the other code. And it also has the side affect of no one other than the company that 'owns' the other code actually works on those kernels - which I assume is the state Canonical is already in, as there's bugger all 'community' development of ubuntu kernels anyway
2016-02-20 06:58:00	 > 	chemist69 (~apl@a89-182-60-153.net-htp.de) has joined #linuxvoice
2016-02-20 07:00:22	einonm	result is, kernels that are developed proprietary-style that are of poorer quality, because no one company can keep up with the pace of kernel development. Best of luck with that.

2016-02-21 04:34:07	Devilment	I use autoaway.pl on irssi. It just sets me away, no nick change

2016-02-21 04:43:25	SuperEngineer	oh, if only all "offenders" did similar, Devilment
2016-02-21 04:46:05	SuperEngineer	no names, no pack drill eh, foxhunt_away [& lcawte on #ubuntu-uk]... but no names, no pack drill. [/me chuckles]
2016-02-21 04:46:09	zmoylan-pi	you can always mark them as ignored
2016-02-21 04:46:19	SuperEngineer	[done!]
2016-02-21 04:48:54	SuperEngineer	[but every now & then I "unignore"... & regret it!]  ;-)
2016-02-21 04:49:30	Devilment	I should use my hi-fi stack more often to listen to my music rather than my PC
2016-02-21 04:49:43	Devilment	Been doing that this afternoon, far punchier
2016-02-21 04:50:16	Devilment	Although, I'd accidentally turned the volume up to 11 when dusting
2016-02-21 04:50:33	Devilment	It were a bit loud when the first track kicked in
2016-02-21 04:52:39	SuperEngineer	So why turn it down?  Temporary deafness is a very under rated result sometimes ;-)
2016-02-21 04:54:07	Devilment	Amp is 68W, speakers are rated for 100W. Didn't want to clip and potentially damage driver coils
2016-02-21 04:54:40	Devilment	Audiolab 8000S, very clean, very neutral amp
2016-02-21 04:55:20	zmoylan-pi	my brother picked up an amp as a teenager that came with speakers the size of stools.  when connected to his stereo and volume set to 3 it sounded like pub across road was having concert... :-)
2016-02-21 04:55:20		[04:55]
2016-02-21 04:56:58	Devilment	My speakers are about 30 years old. Mission 762i
2016-02-21 04:57:13	Devilment	They have the woofer over the tweeter
2016-02-21 04:57:25	Devilment	Good bass on them
2016-02-21 04:57:48	*	SuperEngineer keeps mouth shut & hides jealousy
2016-02-21 04:58:10	Devilment	Over the amp or speakers?
2016-02-21 05:04:00		[04:58]
2016-02-21 05:12:16	SuperEngineer	yes
2016-02-21 05:16:23	*	SuperEngineer has speakers rated to 1000W [each], has an amp that begs to drive up to "fun" level... but doesn't live where it can be used
2016-02-21 05:19:11	SuperEngineer	so puts up with mediocre 6 way home cinema player for all use... but... but...but...

2016-02-21 21:14:37	charlesay	on a scale from one to project ending, where is that linux mint compromise set?
2016-02-21 21:15:56	zmoylan-pi	probably 2-3, a security cockup. but i'm glad it occurred and was caught
2016-02-21 21:18:07	mcphail	what happened?
2016-02-21 21:18:07		[21:18]
2016-02-21 21:19:45	mcphail	http://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=2994 - aargh. Nasty
2016-02-21 21:22:07	zmoylan-pi	spring is here, the daily mail hacker is no longer wearing a hoodie... :-) http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/02/18/12/0236EF8900000578-3452774-image-m-93_1455800012124.jpg
2016-02-21 21:22:12	mcphail	Depressingly, they've published MD5 hashes under "How to check if your ISO is compromised?" rather than something signed with their GPG key. FFS
2016-02-21 21:22:53	zmoylan-pi	more people would know how to use a hash probably
2016-02-21 21:23:40	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: a hash is useless if the scumbags can rewrite your website and modify the MD5s
2016-02-21 21:24:11	zmoylan-pi	the server they got access to is still down according to that blog
2016-02-21 21:24:52	mcphail	Yes, but looks as if it had been kept up for a further 24h after the initial discovering, hosting a new compromised .ISO

2016-02-21 21:29:31	charlesay	what is the point of a linux distro: packaging linux and other stuff into something useful and deliver it to people. that is exactly what they fucked up enormously
2016-02-21 21:32:21	charlesay	they should have signed the isos with gpg keys (that others aren't doing this either doesn't make it any better). they/we should use secure boot to mitigate this. they shouldn't host their isos on the same box/vm as their bloody wordpress. they shouldn't use md5. they shouldn't need to be told by people commenting on the blog that the site is still/again compromised...

Knowing I can move/live around Europe is a huge part of what I consider my identity. Less integration takes us down an increasingly insular path, and I find that thought very depressing.

2016-02-23 02:30:53	Blackisle	one of the usual opt-out issues is the huge amount of red-tape you need to go through to sell stuff in the EU. We manufacture machines so the vast majority oif the red-tape is to do with the CE mark
2016-02-23 02:31:12	Blackisle	whether we're in or out, you still need a CE mark to sell in the EU
2016-02-23 02:31:42	Blackisle	so it's idiotic not to be part of the EU and at least try to steer some of the standards decisions made

2016-02-23 20:22:36	zmoylan-pi	i don't think it even comes close to worst video game
2016-02-23 20:23:37	zmoylan-pi	atari who spent millions for rights to a game which they rushed out in 3 weeks with 1 programmer are to blame methinks
2016-02-23 20:28:28	Devilment	In the 90s, I "played" a game called Pax <something> from a French software house. Set in the future, there was background radiation as a hazard. Said radiation killed my character within 5 minutes.
2016-02-23 20:28:28		[20:28]
2016-02-23 20:28:41	Devilment	That was the worst game I ever played
2016-02-23 20:28:59	zmoylan-pi	collywobbles on zx spectrum, a gauntlet clone, unplayable
2016-02-23 20:29:17	Devilment	4-5 cycles of "Start game. Die." and I uninstalled it
2016-02-23 20:30:19	zmoylan-pi	i just pushed tape to back of shelf and never loaded it again...
2016-02-23 20:32:50	mcphail	I think, to be properly bad, a game must have had some degree of hype and expectation which it spectacularly failed to meet. There are 1000s of back-bedroom Speccy games which were awful, but no-one would have expected them to be good
2016-02-23 20:33:54	zmoylan-pi	well collywobbles had great looking graphics and synthisized speech and sound so effort HAD been put in
2016-02-23 20:34:08	zmoylan-pi	but was ruined by bugs
2016-02-23 20:35:15	zmoylan-pi	about a 1/3 of the games i had were never reviewed by magazines so you had no other way of knowing what to avoid for a lot of games
2016-02-23 20:35:36	zmoylan-pi	no internet to check them out
2016-02-23 20:40:29	Devilment	Daikatana, Duke Nukem Forever

2016-02-23 20:43:27	mcphail	I've been tempted to but Daikatana, to see if it is as bad as everyone says
2016-02-23 20:43:31	mcphail	*buy

2016-02-23 20:54:12	Devilment	I picked up a couple of LED "golfball" bulbs y'day from Poundland. Rated at 5W / 330lm.

2016-02-23 20:55:08	Devilment	They're to be used in a couple of mood-lighting lamps, but I tried them in my wall lights first, just to see how they compared to the 8W CFLs I'm already using
2016-02-23 20:55:33	Devilment	I was surprised they were just as bright, if not a touch brighter

2016-02-23 20:56:19	Devilment	At £1/bulb, it'll take a year for them to pay back their costs if I replaced them :)

2016-02-23 20:57:29	mcphail	CFLs need to die. Horrible horrible things
2016-02-23 20:58:08	james_olympus	Sounds good.  My kitchen has ten 20W halogens.  I don't like to use the ceiling lights, they're close to gaming graphics card territory
2016-02-23 20:58:16	Devilment	I've used low energy lighting since I got the house, so have no comparison to running lighting using incandescents
2016-02-23 20:58:41	Devilment	Often wondered how much a reduction people who have swapped over see in their leccy bills
2016-02-23 20:58:41		[20:58]
2016-02-23 20:59:15	mcphail	Devilment: they're nasty, and prone to explode. Wouldn't be so bad if they weren't full of mercury
2016-02-23 20:59:40	Devilment	Prone to explode?
2016-02-23 20:59:57	Devilment	And they're not full of mercury
2016-02-23 21:05:00		[20:59]
2016-02-23 21:11:06	Devilment	http://earthtechling.com/2011/10/the-mercury-myth-how-much-mercury-do-cfls-actually-contain/
2016-02-23 21:11:23	mcphail	Devilment: they fail with a bang. I had one pop like a gunshot a couple of months ago, followed by a foul cabbage smell. I'll admit "full of" is hyperbole, but they do contain mercury and they do explode
2016-02-23 21:11:47	*	mcphail would like to stress the foul cabbage smell did not come from his trousers
2016-02-23 21:12:45	Devilment	Well, I've never had one explode on me and that's from a house with one in nearly every fitting
2016-02-23 21:13:22	mcphail	http://www.maine.gov/dep/homeowner/cflreport.html
2016-02-23 21:17:11	Devilment	I still maintain the "ZOMG! Mercury!" risk is over-hyped for CFLs
2016-02-23 21:19:02	zmoylan-pi	still sitting on those cfl manufacturers shares? :-)
2016-02-23 21:19:23	Devilment	Nope
2016-02-23 21:19:49	Devilment	I have buggy-whip manufacturer shares though :)

2016-02-24 00:29:43	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: the code I wote in the 80's went '10 PRINT "McPhail Rules OK" 20 GOTO 10'

2016-02-26 05:50:02	l0b0	What should I do when my comment has been "awaiting moderation" for two days?

2016-02-26 05:51:12	l0b0	Yes, last Voice of the Masses
2016-02-26 05:51:29	l0b0	I wrote a relatively long comment about Awesome WM
2016-02-26 05:51:31	@degville	Just approved it.
2016-02-26 05:51:38	l0b0	:)
2016-02-26 05:51:41	@degville	Sorry. Not sure why isn't wasn't checked.

2016-02-26 19:57:45	Mihaly	hey yeah... had a slight addition for your finds ... "du -Sh" will give a "human-readable" "Summary" showing only the essential result,
2016-02-26 19:58:06	@degville	thanks Mihaly. I'll give it a go.
2016-02-26 19:58:42	Mihaly	but the really clever bit is that if you "du -Sh *" it shows a listing of directories sizes - really handy occasionally. Thats the clever bit.
2016-02-26 20:01:45	swift110-phone	Hmm
2016-02-26 20:03:40	Mihaly	it will also show your dot directories... which may be a downside.... but if you're wondering where all that data usage exactly /is/ under your main CWD, that's the command that will show you.
2016-02-26 20:04:17	Mihaly	it depends what your CWD is, of course...
2016-02-26 20:08:08	Mihaly	am on Sydney time here. excuse me... sorry. Am catching up on latest podcats
2016-02-26 20:08:16	jimbotux	morning :)
2016-02-26 20:08:38	Mihaly	Andrew has just opened the packaging ....
2016-02-26 20:08:47	jimbotux	http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/26/canonical_in_zfsonlinux_gpl_violation_spat/
2016-02-26 20:08:52	Mihaly	good evening
2016-02-26 20:10:28	jimbotux	are canonical in the wrong here? I was under the assumption that ZFS couldnt be distributed with GPL software? So I think they are wrong.
2016-02-26 20:10:41	jimbotux	But im no license expert...
2016-02-26 20:10:46	mcphail	Mihaly: a useful added switch is "-t" which will only print out directories over the given size threshold, e.g. "du -Sh -t 100M ."
2016-02-26 20:10:49	Mihaly	so who /may/ use ZFS, and is it a problem? Surely ZFS isn't recquired, it;s optional? we could choose to use any FS
2016-02-26 20:11:03	jimbotux	They are making it the default for containers
2016-02-26 20:11:21	jimbotux	So when you rev up a ubuntu lxc i think its the default fs
2016-02-26 20:11:26	Mihaly	ah,noce touch Mcphail! is it +t or -t?
2016-02-26 20:11:42	mcphail	jimbotux: I think Canonical are straying into territory which is only going to distract them from more useful things
2016-02-26 20:12:10	mcphail	Mihaly: I think you can add a + or - to the size itself for "bigger or smaller than"
2016-02-26 20:12:32	jimbotux	ZFS is great tho! I really want it to come to Linux properly without this whole external repos etc
2016-02-26 20:13:00	jimbotux	So as much as i dislike canonical this could be really good!
2016-02-26 20:13:12	Mihaly	I suppose I usually would have used some form of post-cmd filter, or the sort , but I'm no command libne guru.
2016-02-26 20:13:31	mcphail	jimbotux: even if they "win" the legal argument, they're going to be left maintaining a filesystem which has been largely abandoned upstream and will never reach kernel support. Just crazy
2016-02-26 20:14:32	 > 	andybalaam (andybalaam@nat/ibm/x-wtubnkapybeznbqb) has joined #linuxvoice
2016-02-26 20:14:47	Mihaly	say something like "du -Sh -t100M *" to show only directories >100M in size? but I was only trying to just be clever, and I'm not nearly that
2016-02-26 20:15:30	Mihaly	and wouldn't you have to specifiy Mb or whatever to fit with the -h delimiter format?
2016-02-26 20:16:10	Mihaly	BTW how common in actual /usage/ is ZFS?
2016-02-26 20:16:40	mcphail	Mihaly: you've specified 100M - you don't need anything fancier to further specify the size. Good to go already
2016-02-26 20:19:03	Mihaly	I guess I was simply using what I would use, and I daren't go too much further, so if I needed to I would scroll back, but yeah you're right specifying size with the t option would add to the ability to hone in on certain directories. I don't actually use the command frequent;y enough
2016-02-26 20:19:31	mcphail	Mihaly: I use it to track down disk-hogs on my phone
2016-02-26 20:23:32	Mihaly	something just to the left of that website mentioned zfs above - Euro Patent office heads rapidly toward meltdown .... WTF?!!
2016-02-26 20:24:13	jimbotux	mcphail, i dont think its abandoned at all? https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/graphs/contributors
2016-02-26 20:24:18	Mihaly	argghh! Just noticed the other headline as well ... huge licencing fees??
2016-02-26 20:25:13	jimbotux	Looks fairly active. Also joyent run ZFS on smartOS and it backs their whole cloud. So i really dont think its abandoned
2016-02-26 20:25:21	Mihaly	I just stopped when you could basically get your head around efs3/4 - journalling useful for sysadmins, fine, but for home users?
2016-02-26 20:25:35	Mihaly	and what about BTRFS?
2016-02-26 20:27:55	Mihaly	thats all the weather for now - value for money - i agree wholeheartedly. and you will stay in the eu. I tried to support you with PayPal, but you wouldn't accept my payment, so I just bought two copies of issue 24 LinuxVoice.
2016-02-26 20:28:32	Mihaly	hmmm, nice ending music. like it.
2016-02-26 20:29:55	Mihaly	Beep Beep Yargh - hope it does well. Best wishes honestly.
2016-02-26 20:30:34	@degville	thanks :) the ending music is there because I didn't have the right mix of Brad Sucks handy, but I had the music I did for the Beep Beep Yarr video.
2016-02-26 20:31:07	@degville	we had lots of technical issues with that podcast and I couldn't spend any more time on it.
2016-02-26 20:32:01	Mihaly	it turned out fine as far as I could tell -I only buy it for the articles as you know :)
2016-02-26 20:34:16	Mihaly	have to sign off for the moment, Silent Witness coming on TV now. Will catch up later?
2016-02-26 20:34:23	@degville	Speak to you later!
2016-02-26 20:34:35	Mihaly	cheers!

2016-02-27 08:36:59	dankeast	unix lost out on the microcomputer market early on because it was considered too low powerful. dos filled that market, which destroyed the minicomputers...
2016-02-27 08:37:45	dankeast	sounds like the reverse is happening since the unix oses are the only things that will fit on these tiny things

2016-03-02 21:59:19	mcphail	Ioangogo: to suggest school rugby is a dangerous sport. No point denying that - it is well documented. I'm happy for kids to be allowed to play rugby, but _compulsory_ full-contact rugby is scandalous. Sports with high risks of life changing (and life threatening) injuries should be opt-in only
2016-03-02 22:00:15	mcphail	Sam goes for horse riding and rock climbing. The function of a PE class is to promote fitness, and that doesn't require dangerous sporting activity
2016-03-02 22:01:03	zmoylan-pi	but for horse riding helmets are required?
2016-03-02 22:01:14	zmoylan-pi	ditto rock climbinb?
2016-03-02 22:01:53	Devilment	Camping needs to be banned as an extreme sport. It's in tents
2016-03-02 22:01:58	zmoylan-pi	they could make helmets mandatory for rugby but new evidence is suggesting that helmets might make sports like american football *more* dangerous as riskier tackles are done
2016-03-02 22:03:54	Devilment	It's like boxing should go back to bare knuckles
2016-03-02 22:04:09	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: it is hard to pick apart the confounding factors of increased injuries in rugby and American football. The widespread abuse of anabolic steroids has coincided with the introduction of helmets etc. Players are heavier and travelling quicker, making injuries more likely
2016-03-02 22:04:50	Devilment	Let's add more mass and protection to a boxer's hand. That will stop them from hitting as hard. Oh, wait...
2016-03-02 22:05:27	zmoylan-pi	it's also a he'll be grand, the helmet will take the impact from my kneecap
2016-03-02 22:06:34	Devilment	It's funny how additions to make things safer can have the opposite effect
2016-03-02 22:07:00	zmoylan-pi	if you make things safer people take more risks
2016-03-02 22:07:14	Devilment	All the safety improvements to road cars means people are more likely to speed on the motorway
2016-03-02 22:07:42	zmoylan-pi	they'll walk away from a crash, pity about those nuns crossing the road...
2016-03-02 22:08:04	Devilment	Strip back the padding in American Football, go back to the 1930s/1940s style
2016-03-02 22:08:43	Devilment	If it's going to hurt you when you go in for the tackle, you're not going to hit as hard
2016-03-02 22:09:22	zmoylan-pi	and add a few sensors so that you can calulate the force used to that you can penalised for overtackling
2016-03-02 22:09:47	zmoylan-pi	the difference between getting the ball and removing their best player from the match
2016-03-02 22:09:52	mcphail	Devilment: padding has the advantage of making players slower. Kinetic energy increases by velocity^2, so slowing players is a good idea to prevent injuries. Better to make the padding heavier, as the relationship between kinetic energy and mass is linear
2016-03-02 22:10:09	Devilment	There were concerns about footballers getting cumulative brain damage from heading the ball. Yes, make your own jokes about brain-dead footballers
2016-03-02 22:10:33	zmoylan-pi	doesn't need to be heavy to do that, just make it inflexible and bulky to reduce their movement
2016-03-02 22:10:41	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: ineed
2016-03-02 22:10:43	Devilment	I can imagine heading a football from the 1950s/60s hurting a lot
2016-03-02 22:11:19	zmoylan-pi	and there's a movie at the mo about tackles in american football causing permanent brain damage

2016-03-02 22:14:18	Devilment	My nephew has had to give up his rugby

2016-03-02 22:46:27	TwistedLucidity	Also, the ring could be safer due to it being an actual cage. Insufficient data just now though.

2016-03-04 02:17:19	james_olympus	My answer was "I don't know, I'd look it up", which is about as good as knowing it
2016-03-04 02:17:26	Stilvoid	definitely
2016-03-04 02:17:29	pwaring	yes, I'd always accept that answer
2016-03-04 02:17:38	pwaring	In fact, I'd prefer someone who looks it up just to check

2016-03-04 02:18:10	pwaring	I was asked how I would learn a new programming language
2016-03-04 02:18:19	pwaring	My answer was "buy the O'Reilly animal book and read it"
2016-03-04 02:18:20	Stilvoid	wikipedia and learnxinyminutes.com
2016-03-04 02:18:37	pwaring	I've found websites quite a poor choice for learning new things
2016-03-04 02:18:48	pwaring	Books have a structure and consistency which websites often lack
2016-03-04 02:18:57	james_olympus	pwaring: I've had that a couple of times, but my answer is to start programming as quickly as possible
2016-03-04 02:19:12	pwaring	james_olympus: yeah, I would be programming whilst I was readingthe book
2016-03-04 02:19:22	pwaring	i.e. read a bit, try it, read a bit etc.
2016-03-04 02:19:24	Stilvoid	ah I just find books a bit slow-going
2016-03-04 02:19:32	Stilvoid	usually the bit I actually want to know is about 2/3 of the way in

2016-03-04 02:34:53	Devilment	Having a file called - in a directory can be a useful brake on rm *, IIRC
2016-03-04 02:36:18	Devilment	Nope, just bust it
2016-03-04 02:36:55	pwaring	heh
2016-03-04 02:37:08	pwaring	Every year there would be at least one student who ran rm -rf ${HOME}

2016-03-04 02:38:12	james_olympus	Were any of them running Steam illicitly?
2016-03-04 02:38:13	Devilment	I'm sure in the past I've managed to create a trap file to prevent rm *
2016-03-04 02:39:42	pwaring	james_olympus: unlikely, we only gave them 2GB of quota which I doubt would be enough to install Steam + any modern game
2016-03-04 02:39:59	pwaring	There was a big fanfare this year when quotas were increased to 5GB
2016-03-04 02:40:03	pwaring	FIVE GIGABYTES
2016-03-04 02:40:50	zmoylan-pi	wow, i had 64k on pdp 11 at college
2016-03-04 02:43:12	pwaring	We had about 200MB
2016-03-04 02:43:37	pwaring	I remember having to justify getting more when I was working on a research project
2016-03-04 02:43:37	Devilment	Trying to think how much we had at university
2016-03-04 02:44:16	Devilment	Using Risc iX on Acorn R260 machines
2016-03-04 02:44:17	zmoylan-pi	i printed programs out and retyped them when i needed them to save space... did help with my final typing test... :-)
2016-03-04 02:44:48	Devilment	n07t8 was my university network sign-on
2016-03-04 02:45:01	Devilment	Funny the things you remember
2016-03-04 02:45:18	zmoylan-pi	atarist was my password

2016-03-04 02:46:16	zmoylan-pi	it was a trick, i really wanted an amiga... :-)

2016-03-04 02:47:18	TwistedLucidity	Huh....I wonder how a RasPi stacks up against and Archimedes?
2016-03-04 02:47:33	Devilment	Much, much faster
2016-03-04 02:47:34	zmoylan-pi	it blows it away
2016-03-04 02:47:40	zmoylan-pi	and that was with the pi2

2016-03-04 02:48:10	TwistedLucidity	Kinda thought it would, just wonder what the actual difference is
2016-03-04 02:48:10	Devilment	Acorn A5000, ARM3 either 25MHz or 33MHz
2016-03-04 02:48:14	Stilvoid	why the hell I remember those I have no idea
2016-03-04 02:48:19	Stilvoid	because I had to change the password right away
2016-03-04 02:48:40	Devilment	Acorn StrongARM RiscPC, 233MHz
2016-03-04 02:49:28	Devilment	What's the clock on the R-Pi2? 900MHz?
2016-03-04 02:49:51	Stilvoid	Worrying that my 14MHz Amiga often feels faster than my 1.3GHz desktop machine
2016-03-04 02:49:57	Stilvoid	tbf though, I'm about to retire that :)
2016-03-04 02:50:35	Devilment	Problem with RISC OS is it being CMT not PMT
2016-03-04 02:51:07	Devilment	4 cores in an R-Pi2 running RISC OS means 4 hourglasses :)
2016-03-04 02:51:36	Devilment	I was an Acorn user back in the day but I got better
2016-03-04 02:52:18	pwaring	When I was working at the uni, we *gave* every student a RPi 2
2016-03-04 02:52:35	pwaring	I'm assuming they'll get an RPi 3 this year
2016-03-04 02:52:53	TwistedLucidity	pwaring: Don't forget the heatsinks....
2016-03-04 02:53:06	mcphail	How are the RPi3's working out?
2016-03-04 02:53:13	pwaring	Not got one yet
2016-03-04 02:53:22	pwaring	Still haven't played with my MIPS CI20 board
2016-03-04 02:53:56	Devilment	pwaring: For paying your £9000 tutition fees, have this £25 computer
2016-03-04 02:54:15	Devilment	Sounds like a fair trade
2016-03-04 02:54:17	pwaring	heh
2016-03-04 02:54:49	pwaring	yeah, the quota thing was a big issue: "we're paying £9k, can't we have more than that?"
2016-03-04 02:55:17	Devilment	"OK, we'll throw in a micro-USB cable."
2016-03-04 02:55:18	pwaring	Even was I was a student, it was embarrassing that the CS file server was less well-specced and fell over more than the computer society one
2016-03-04 02:55:32	pwaring	Devilment: They do get an Element14 box with a power supply and a case!
2016-03-04 02:56:19	TwistedLucidity	pwaring: The CompSoc server had more "staff" willing to do overtime.....

2016-03-04 02:57:05	pwaring	CompSoc had three students :)
2016-03-04 02:57:12	TwistedLucidity	Ah
2016-03-04 02:57:28	TwistedLucidity	Maybe they should have exchanged roles? :-P
2016-03-04 02:57:29	pwaring	The sysadmin staff have gone now though, everything has been centralised, cut back and outsourced
2016-03-04 02:57:48	pwaring	In a complete coincidence, service levels have fallen drastically
2016-03-04 02:57:56	TwistedLucidity	I'm dealing with outsourced cloud-y bullshit right now
2016-03-04 02:58:09	TwistedLucidity	"We will use da clowds to save the monies!
2016-03-04 02:58:16	TwistedLucidity	Which is then followed by
2016-03-04 02:58:23	pwaring	Manchester got rid of their IT Director recently, it was on the Register
2016-03-04 02:58:32	TwistedLucidity	"No, you cannot have a copy of production as it's too expensive."
2016-03-04 02:58:38	pwaring	He tried to outsource everything in a Grand Plan and it went horribly wrong
2016-03-04 02:59:52	zmoylan-pi	everything in the cloud to save money and then when the internet keeps going down it gets to be fun... :-)
2016-03-04 02:59:58	TwistedLucidity	To be fair, there is a balance. If you don't need something all the time, or it's not core/vital to your business, outsource it. Otherwise....
2016-03-04 03:00:40	pwaring	sure
2016-03-04 03:00:48	pwaring	He planned to outsource most stuff though
2016-03-04 03:01:17	pwaring	Also, it's hard to outsource some things because few companies will meet the specialist requirements of academia
2016-03-04 03:01:50	TwistedLucidity	The other problem with outsourcing is you set the relationship in stone. Any variance, no matter how minor, is a cost. As NHS trusts etc are finding out, but are still compelled to use PFI etc
2016-03-04 03:02:15	mcphail	Being completely ignorant of these things, what is the biggest expense in keeping something in house? Electricity? Cooling?
2016-03-04 03:02:50	zmoylan-pi	space used
2016-03-04 03:03:04	zmoylan-pi	insurance on top of that
2016-03-04 03:03:05	TwistedLucidity	mcphail: Depends on the "thing"
2016-03-04 03:04:10	mcphail	Well, take pwaring's University situation. Where are the finincial gains in outsourcing coming from?
2016-03-04 03:04:40	zmoylan-pi	lower upkeep costs probably
2016-03-04 03:05:30	Stilvoid	By the way, shameless time, if any of you folks have AWS (or any other cloud provider) skills and fancy a change of job... PM me ;)
2016-03-04 03:05:38	Stilvoid	We are *heavily* recruiting

2016-03-04 03:07:19	esprimo	Where?
2016-03-04 03:07:22	Stilvoid	Sorry, didn't make that terrible clear!
2016-03-04 03:08:12	pwaring	mcphail: I think if you outsource you convert capital expenditure into operating expenditure and that is 'good' (in accounting terms)
2016-03-04 03:08:19	pwaring	I don't think it saves you money
2016-03-04 03:08:40	Stilvoid	The office is in London but I work from home usually 3 days a week and drop in to the office for a couple of hours on mondays and thursdays
2016-03-04 03:08:49	esprimo	Cool
2016-03-04 03:08:50	pwaring	Stilvoid: Do you consider freelancers?
2016-03-04 03:09:01	esprimo	Sounds nice
2016-03-04 03:09:04	Stilvoid	don't think so
2016-03-04 03:09:12	pwaring	fair enough
2016-03-04 03:09:15	pwaring	Worth asking :)
2016-03-04 03:09:35	TwistedLucidity	I have virtual AWS skills; does that count?

2016-03-04 03:09:58	Stilvoid	heh
2016-03-04 03:10:05	Stilvoid	we could virtually employ you ;)

2016-03-04 03:13:52	TwistedLucidity	Ioangogo: Government wants more sheckles for the BBC so they can cut central funding. Then turn the BBC private.
2016-03-04 03:14:01	zmoylan-pi	government is allergic to giving stuff away for free
2016-03-04 03:14:15	TwistedLucidity	In fairness, iPlayer is probably the single best catch-up service available.
2016-03-04 03:14:29	Ioangogo	That sounds silly though, its uninforcable
2016-03-04 03:14:53	TwistedLucidity	The other companies were stupid to not get on-board with the BBC's plans. The offerings from All4 etc are horrendous.
2016-03-04 03:15:00	zmoylan-pi	bittorrent is a bit better as it just works everywhere... which is sad really as i'd like to get a lot of stuff legit

2016-03-04 03:15:14	Ioangogo	Just use intigo an no one will know
2016-03-04 03:15:47	pwaring	Ioangogo: It's not the BBC's choice as the TV Licensing rules are set out in legislation (Communications Act 2003)
2016-03-04 03:16:10	pwaring	So the BBC can't just decide whether you need a TV license for something
2016-03-04 03:17:20	TwistedLucidity	The BBC might need to think about switching to something more like PBS in the USA. And halve its funding. And firing 50% of all managers.

2016-03-04 03:18:05	mcphail	Well, that is 2 stories in 2 days which make me want to have a "stern word" with John Whittingdale
2016-03-04 03:18:09	zmoylan-pi	and within 10 years it'll be as bad as itv
2016-03-04 03:18:57	pwaring	TwistedLucidity: The Sun will complain until the BBC is shutdown
2016-03-04 03:19:15	TwistedLucidity	I can see large sections of the TV industry going to the wall soon. We have little need for broadcast channels of old, but we still need good editors etc to curate content.
2016-03-04 03:19:22	TwistedLucidity	Otherwise you get ITV....

2016-03-04 03:22:42	james_olympus	Most of my television viewing is BBC documentaries.  There's one on tonight about Pompeii

2016-03-04 03:24:36	james_olympus	If you'll need a licence for the Iplayer, will there be a black and white version?

2016-03-04 03:24:44	Stilvoid	commercial radio is horrible :(
2016-03-04 03:25:06	TwistedLucidity	I'd rather throw money in a pot and then when I watch something, the creator get a pit of the pot. Kinda like Flattr I guess.
2016-03-04 03:25:26	TwistedLucidity	I hate having to pay for crap I don't watch. e.g. NatGeo. Urgh, what a waste of electorns.

2016-03-04 03:26:59	mcphail	And if the licence is extended to iplayer, no reason they wouldn't extend it to cover netflix or youtube

2016-03-04 07:48:33	Landru	So, what's the most reasonable way for Muricans to get the magazine? It seemed a bit pricey at Barnes and Noble, but I'm not unwilling to get it there. My only concern is that I bought the only copy they had.
2016-03-04 07:48:51	Landru	I deprived someone of their fix, or someone will deprive me of mine next month, I fear.

2016-03-04 08:01:10	Landru	I have to say, I hadn't heard of the Ubuntu podcast until this past December, and I grabbed the latest podcast and quite enjoyed it. And then there was this three month lag where I thought it had died, and I was bitter. But now it's back.
2016-03-04 08:01:20	popey	hehe

2016-03-04 08:02:23	Landru	Anyway, these two podcasts are my only free-software podcasts at the moment. Maybe it's my anglophilia, but all the American podcasts seem a bit tacky by comparison.

2016-03-04 08:08:53	Landru	Other side of the Atlantic? GPL-haters?
2016-03-04 08:10:56	popey	Their strapline is based on prefering older stuff to new stuff
2016-03-04 08:11:03	popey	(yet they spend a lot of time reviewing new stuff)
2016-03-04 08:11:19	popey	Joe is of the opinion that everyone should stop writing new code, and should instead fix all the old stuff first.
2016-03-04 08:11:25	popey	So, opposite of that.
2016-03-04 08:11:46	Landru	Ah. I'll enjoy that then. I'm often a dinosaur.

2016-03-04 09:44:31	charlesa1	ChibaPet: i had those mounted
2016-03-04 09:45:31	ChibaPet	Hrm. That's a bit odd then.
2016-03-04 09:45:50	charlesa1	i think what was wrong was (me being stupid and having) /boot not mounted when i installed a kernel, so there was nothing there for grub to find and put in its config
2016-03-04 09:45:53	ChibaPet	RAID involved? Sometimes RAID will spin up as, say, md127 when you really want md0.
2016-03-04 09:46:00	ChibaPet	ah
2016-03-04 09:46:04	ChibaPet	That'd do it. I've done that.
2016-03-04 09:46:28	charlesa1	i guess i'll find out when i turn the machine on now
2016-03-04 09:48:12	charlesa1	i have never been happier to read 'no key available with this passphrase'
2016-03-04 09:49:02	ChibaPet	heh
2016-03-04 09:49:10	charlesa1	because that means that cryptsetup is actually running on my machine, which it hasn't in weeks
2016-03-04 09:49:43	charlesa1	because of some joint fuck up of the kernel and cryptsetup that rendered my machine unusable
2016-03-04 09:50:28	charlesa1	i had hoped to boot my real machine by midnight, so got there by 11 min..
2016-03-04 09:51:41	charlesa1	in the meantime i found out that i don't like gnome out of the box, esp on fedora

2016-03-04 10:05:58	ChibaPet	Wasteful of screen real estate.
2016-03-04 10:06:51	ChibaPet	Openbox with the Onyx theme is much less wasteful.

2016-03-08 08:40:24	dankeast	no idea why you'd install it over postgres on a linux box, but still
2016-03-08 08:41:00	dankeast	interesting to compare with the other stuff i've been reading about ms today: http://venturebeat.com/2016/03/05/why-epics-tim-sweeney-blasted-micrsooft-in-bid-to-keep-windows-10-open/
2016-03-08 08:43:25	zmoylan-pi	a pig flying would be more reliable than sql on linux...
2016-03-08 08:46:33	dankeast	ms sql, or just sql in general?
2016-03-08 08:48:11	dankeast	does ms have a document based db?
2016-03-08 08:52:26	post	office 365 ;)
2016-03-08 08:53:25	dankeast	hah :)
2016-03-08 08:59:10	dankeast	i wish instead of ms word people were used to git + markdown
2016-03-08 08:59:51	zmoylan-pi	but is there a single defined standard of markdown or lots of variants...
2016-03-08 09:00:03	dankeast	yeah, that's the downside
2016-03-08 09:00:07	dankeast	definitely the second
2016-03-08 09:00:19	post	also latex seems a bit messy. but wasn't word once like markdown, on msdos ...
2016-03-08 09:00:20	dankeast	is there a single defined standard of ms documents though?
2016-03-08 09:00:30	zmoylan-pi	and does it cover all bases or is it missing features...
2016-03-08 09:01:10	dankeast	depends on the use case. the vast majority of the documents i end up having to trawl through are headings paragraphs, images and links
2016-03-08 09:01:17	zmoylan-pi	coz i did look at markdown recently and it was missing a page break which would have been nice
2016-03-08 09:01:34	dankeast	something i'd like to see a git history for, and be able to grep
2016-03-08 09:02:30	dankeast	yeah, for actual type setting it's not enough. it's rare that's actually the case... and that's something you could apply to the file
2016-03-08 09:04:27	dankeast	for a project i've started on at work i've been given a document describing an interface
2016-03-08 09:04:53	dankeast	with xsd schemas nested inside
2016-03-08 09:05:10	dankeast	copy & paste and you get all the numbered page breaks too
2016-03-08 09:05:23	dankeast	there's a data definition. i can't grep it
2016-03-08 09:05:41	dankeast	s/definition/dictionary/
2016-03-08 09:06:20	dankeast	the text describing it all are just that
2016-03-08 09:06:56	dankeast	maybe it's not even markdown + git. maybe it's just not straight away reaching for the office tools
2016-03-08 09:08:41	post	i like pandoc

2016-03-08 09:09:17	zmoylan-pi	over the years i've kinda settled on 7bit ascii so i know it'll open in anything
2016-03-08 09:10:16	dankeast	yeah, i installed pandoc the other day. i like it  alot
2016-03-08 09:10:32	dankeast	yeah. plain text all the way
2016-03-08 09:13:50	zmoylan-pi	you just have to get 'creative' with *bold* /italic/ and _underline_ plus line breaks and indents
2016-03-08 09:16:41	dankeast	i guess with something like pandoc you can actually get page breaks
2016-03-08 09:16:47	dankeast	make each section a separate file
2016-03-08 09:20:25	dankeast	html has it right with the separation of content and style, it's just that it's xml
2016-03-08 09:20:33	dankeast	well, sort of
2016-03-08 09:22:59	 < 	post (~dayf@ip5f5b0a40.dynamic.kabel-deutschland.de) has left #linuxvoice ("Left.")
2016-03-08 09:24:11	zmoylan-pi	if html had page breaks to suggest were to break when it's printed on paper it would do 100% of what i want. without a page break it's no good for documentation or reports
2016-03-08 09:24:44	dankeast	i'm pretty sure css3 now supports pagination

2016-03-08 20:23:42	james_olympus	A bit cloudy here also.  At least it's not raining
2016-03-08 20:25:12	jimbotux	very true, yesterday was magic i had lunch outside and went for a walk in sun.
2016-03-08 20:25:33	jimbotux	today back to standard. dull, cloudy windy

2016-03-08 20:32:17	james_olympus	I know.  ':edit src/' in vim just became ':eric'.  Don't know who Eric is
2016-03-08 20:35:06	Devilment	zmoylan-pi: The irony of someone from RoI complaining about spelling :)

2016-03-09 08:30:59	swift110	about to listen to a podcast and hopefully I can contribute via mumble
2016-03-09 08:31:44	@degville	Those Linux Unplugged episodes come around quickly!
2016-03-09 08:33:40	swift110	yes
2016-03-09 08:33:51	swift110	degville: how did you know which one I was talking abiut
2016-03-09 08:34:21	@degville	When I was on a few weeks ago, I saw you on the mumble server and guessed it would be the same this week.
2016-03-09 08:35:29	swift110	oh thats cool
2016-03-09 08:35:54	@degville	It was good. I enjoyed being on the show. Mumble works really well.
2016-03-09 08:49:58	dankeast	I've been watching the tv program Mr. Robot...
2016-03-09 08:50:08	dankeast	it features characters discussing gnome vs kde
2016-03-09 08:50:51	dankeast	there's a freenode irc channel shown quickly that actually turns out to exist
2016-03-09 08:51:18	dankeast	has people hacking stuff... and it's done way too quickly, but most of it is pretty accurate
2016-03-09 08:51:59	dankeast	not sure what i think about the program, but it's quite shocking for it not to be flashy nonsense when people hack
2016-03-09 08:52:43	@degville	That is rare. It's such a difficult thing to portray accurately, both for the viewer and for the production team.
2016-03-09 08:54:47	dankeast	Absolutely... the flashy stuff is nonsense, but i can completely see why it's that way. it can't be easy to show text on a terminal as exciting
2016-03-09 09:01:00	swift110	thats awesome degville

2016-03-09 23:55:22	zmoylan-pi	how small is your mailbox?
2016-03-09 23:55:31	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: 400MB
2016-03-09 23:55:59	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: I had to put in a special request for one so large
2016-03-09 23:56:17	zmoylan-pi	move it out to a gmail email address and delete it from your inbox?
2016-03-09 23:57:46	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: nope, because "policies"
2016-03-09 23:58:30	zmoylan-pi	then move it to a local file and delete it from email? or delete attachment after moving it and save email?
2016-03-09 23:59:52	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: yeah. Tis the only way. Unfortunately I work at 6 geographically remote locations, without any shared drive infrastructure between them. Email is the only shared resource
2016-03-10 00:00:17	mcphail	so 400MB gets eaten up quickly
2016-03-10 00:00:40	zmoylan-pi	then some bot on your system that will intercept email requests and email you files so that you can request the email send itself to you?
2016-03-10 00:01:59	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: heh. I'll run that one past IT ;)
2016-03-10 00:02:31	zmoylan-pi	i made a program yonks back that did essentially that with outlook express (shows how long ago) for something similar...
2016-03-10 00:03:20	zmoylan-pi	not in the office?  need a file? send an email and it would be sent to you... as long as it came from the right email address. and it would only send it back to that email address...

2016-03-10 00:06:49	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: rather sad there's still a need for hacks like this is 2016. Should be a solved problem in the civilised world. But roaming profiles don't cut the mustard over long distances of copper wire to the back of beyond
2016-03-10 00:06:49	zmoylan-pi	or the alternate is to email it to i.t. people at those 6 locations and tell them you need that file when you are in the location.  the make it someone elses problem solution... :-)
2016-03-10 00:07:55	zmoylan-pi	the shenanigans i did to have access to files in weird locations... i came so close to writing a program to send files via sms at stupid levels of cost per file :-D
2016-03-10 00:08:15	mcphail	ha!
2016-03-10 00:08:34	zmoylan-pi	10p per 140 characters of 7 bit ascii to send a 4-5mb zip was just silly expensive :-)
2016-03-10 00:08:58	mcphail	zmoylan-pi: probably cheaper to hire a courier
2016-03-10 00:09:50	zmoylan-pi	often but sometimes not.  when the recipient was in arse end of ireland it would take courier over a day to get there. and no modems nearby to connect to at glacial speeds of 4800 if you were lucky as phone lines were terrible

2016-03-10 03:30:04	mcphail	I wish I was a Go player. Would love to be following the current match with anything other than bewilderment
2016-03-10 03:45:00	andybalaam	mcphail, I play a tiny bit.  I am watching the match with delighted bewilderment
2016-03-10 03:45:45	mcphail	andybalaam: I meant to try to learn before this one, but didn't find the time. Feel I'm missing a bit of history
2016-03-10 03:45:48	andybalaam	Actually, I play every day on dragongoserver.net I'm just not very good
2016-03-10 03:46:06	andybalaam	I love it
2016-03-10 03:46:10	andybalaam	it just looks so good
2016-03-10 03:47:07	mcphail	Is it newbie friendly?
2016-03-10 03:47:18	andybalaam	the game or the web site?
2016-03-10 03:47:29	mcphail	the latter, but really both :)
2016-03-10 03:47:36	andybalaam	If you play against me, it is :-)
2016-03-10 03:47:53	andybalaam	the game: when I started I found it utterly counterintuitive
2016-03-10 03:47:56	mcphail	ha!
2016-03-10 03:48:04	andybalaam	that was one of the things that really attracted me
2016-03-10 03:48:26	andybalaam	if anyone wants to play, I am andybalaam on dragongoserver.net - just invite me to a game
2016-03-10 03:48:53	andybalaam	it's a correspondance version on that site
2016-03-10 03:48:57	mcphail	I tried playing the gnome go (or whatever) version a few years ago, but would not know where to begin with strategy or tactics
2016-03-10 03:48:59	andybalaam	so you play a couple of moves a day
2016-03-10 03:49:27	mcphail	andybalaam: I'll try to learn the rules then will attempt to give you a challenge :)
2016-03-10 03:49:35	andybalaam	This page is ok: http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicRulesOfGo
2016-03-10 03:50:01	andybalaam	if you buy a physical set it might have the rules in it too
2016-03-10 03:50:46	andybalaam	on the pc I like http://home.gna.org/quarry/ as a board
2016-03-10 03:50:51	andybalaam	you can play GNU Go
2016-03-10 03:51:00	andybalaam	it's not very good, but gives me a strong challenge
2016-03-10 03:51:07	andybalaam	because I'm not very good :-)
2016-03-10 03:51:15	andybalaam	very different from playing a human
2016-03-10 03:51:24	andybalaam	extremely frustrating to lose to
2016-03-10 03:51:29	andybalaam	it kind of takes you apart
2016-03-10 03:51:50	mcphail	Yes - that's the problem, isn't it? I think you really need to play against humans to learn a board game
2016-03-10 03:51:56	andybalaam	yep
2016-03-10 03:52:03	andybalaam	I learnt with someone a lot better than me
2016-03-10 03:52:07	andybalaam	we played every lunch time
2016-03-10 03:52:11	andybalaam	it was exhausting
2016-03-10 03:52:15	andybalaam	but great
2016-03-10 03:52:20	mcphail	how long does a normal game take?
2016-03-10 03:52:27	andybalaam	every game, we re-played afterwards and talked it through
2016-03-10 03:52:38	andybalaam	a 19x19 game could be 1hr
2016-03-10 03:52:42	andybalaam	or much longer
2016-03-10 03:52:52	andybalaam	a 9x9 game could be half an hour or an hour
2016-03-10 03:53:02	mcphail	do you play with a clock, like chess?
2016-03-10 03:53:02	andybalaam	definitely start with 9x9
2016-03-10 03:53:07	andybalaam	yes, in tournaments

2016-03-10 05:25:10	ChibaPet	So, apologies if this has already come up, but http://pandanet-igs.com/communities/pandanet is a vast, popular Internet Go Server with a native Linux client.
2016-03-10 05:25:33	@degville	That's a great find!
2016-03-10 05:25:59	ChibaPet	I found it ages ago, and I play there occasionally. ♥go♥
2016-03-10 05:26:31	ChibaPet	9x9 shouldn't take half an hour, but fifteen line boards are good short-game boards once you are comfortable with the rules.
2016-03-10 05:26:46	zmoylan-pi	do bots have to log in as famous computers now? hal9000, ed209? :-)
2016-03-10 05:27:02	ChibaPet	When I first teach people to play, we play a variant called the Capture Game, where it's normal Go except that the winner is the first to capture any stone.

2016-03-10 05:28:32	ChibaPet	A nifty thing about Go is that players of vastly different skill levels can play fun games, as there's an excellent handicap system that shifts organically to keep the games even and hence fun.

2016-03-10 05:40:33	traceyc	It's Linux, trying something different is tradition :D
2016-03-10 05:40:39	@degville	Cool. I use WeeChat and Konversation
2016-03-10 05:40:50	traceyc	I've liked Konversation for general chat
2016-03-10 05:40:52	zmoylan-pi	obviously not a vim user then... :-P
2016-03-10 05:41:22	traceyc	Actually, I am
2016-03-10 05:41:30	traceyc	It's my preferred cli text editor
2016-03-10 05:42:15	@degville	I must admit, the more times goes on the more command line stuff I seem to be using and experimenting with. I like the lack of distraction.
2016-03-10 05:42:17	ChibaPet	Try something different! Use Emacs for a week.
2016-03-10 05:42:35	traceyc	I don't need an operating system in an operating system, thanks ;)
2016-03-10 05:42:43	zmoylan-pi	is the week to load it? :-)
2016-03-10 05:42:48	traceyc	ha
2016-03-10 05:44:30	zmoylan-pi	i use nano for quick editing, newsbeuter for rss, ttytter for twitter and irssi for irc
2016-03-10 05:44:35	ChibaPet	I don't think vim fans have much ground for attack here. :P
2016-03-10 05:44:50	zmoylan-pi	still looking for easy useful email and spread sheets in console to use under tmux
2016-03-10 05:45:07	ChibaPet	Email's easy. Spreadsheet, probably a lost cause.
2016-03-10 05:45:59	*	traceyc fondly remembers WordPerfect
2016-03-10 05:46:17	zmoylan-pi	i preferred wordstar.... :-)
2016-03-10 05:46:32	zmoylan-pi	the dot commands were useful
2016-03-10 06:00:24	Devilment	There are IRC clients other than irssi?
2016-03-10 06:03:17	zmoylan-pi	so the legends tell us...
2016-03-10 06:04:07	popey	the legends lie

2016-03-10 07:48:09	traceyc	They seemed to be mostly fascinated by the flat look, which is... ok
2016-03-10 07:48:34	traceyc	On the plus side, it's supposed to be lightweight and speedy. On the iffy side, new package management system
2016-03-10 07:49:53	zmoylan-pi	probably a good way to test os performance divorced for sql server performance if you have an alternate sql server other than ms sql server on it... :-)

2016-03-11 07:32:32	ChibaPet	I listened to Ubuntu Voice this morning. Made me wonder what other folks use to normalize volume between speakers. One of the fellows required consistent volume-raising, followed by volume-lowering when anyone else would speak.
2016-03-11 07:33:31	swift110	hey all
2016-03-11 07:33:37	TraceyC	That's a good question. You'd have to use gain control in whatever software you use to play the podcast
2016-03-11 07:33:49	TraceyC	which I really wish I had on my Android for when I listen to the LV podcast
2016-03-11 07:33:52	TraceyC	I should look into it
2016-03-11 07:34:20	swift110	hey TraceyC
2016-03-11 07:34:25	TraceyC	hiya
2016-03-11 07:34:30	swift110	how are you]
2016-03-11 07:34:34	TraceyC	good thanks. You?
2016-03-11 07:39:02	swift110	im great
2016-03-11 07:39:06	swift110	TraceyC: what are you up too
2016-03-11 07:40:52	ChibaPet	TraceyC: No, wrong end. The issue wasn't that I wanted easier raising and lowering of my volume, it's that the different folks speaking were at radically different volumes.
2016-03-11 07:41:06	ChibaPet	They should all be the same, or close.
2016-03-11 07:41:24	ChibaPet	Linux Voice, for instance, tends to have everyone at the same decibel level.
2016-03-11 07:46:05	 < 	jherrmann (jirkah@nat/redhat/x-njucctexegkqrfpx) has quit (Quit: Toodle pip!)
2016-03-11 07:52:57	TraceyC	Yes, that's what I understood :)
2016-03-11 07:53:05	TraceyC	LV is good about it most episodes
2016-03-11 07:53:29	ChibaPet	Ironically, the BBC World News is awful with keeping a consistent volume.
2016-03-11 07:53:52	TraceyC	What a gain control filter does is limit all output to a certain level. So you turn up the volume to your preferred level for the lowest voiced speaker, for instance, turn on gain control and nothing goes over a certain volume
2016-03-11 07:54:06	TraceyC	You'd think the BBC would know about audio recording ;)
2016-03-11 07:54:11	TraceyC	Work, swift110
2016-03-11 07:54:17	ChibaPet	Oh. Right. I see. A solution on my end after all.
2016-03-11 07:54:33	TraceyC	<-went to audio recording school ages ago
2016-03-11 07:54:50	swift110	cool TraceyC

2016-03-15 00:04:46	TraceyC	I have a silly question. Is there a Linux windows manager, aside from KDE, that actually remembers the position of windows from session to session?
2016-03-15 00:05:19	zmoylan-pi	 the tiling eindow manager does that doesn't it?
2016-03-15 00:05:49	zmoylan-pi	i3... was trying to remember the name
2016-03-15 00:07:57	TraceyC	Thanks, looking at their website
2016-03-15 00:08:30	TraceyC	Every morning, when I have to re-position my windows in Cinnamon, I experience that wee little bit of aggravation & desire to fix
2016-03-15 00:08:44	esprimo	zmoylan-pi: i3 can do it but i think you manually have to save the layout
2016-03-15 00:09:05	esprimo	But i3 is tiling so it might not be what you want
2016-03-15 00:09:47	TraceyC	hahaah it looks like KDE1
2016-03-15 00:09:58	TraceyC	Yeah, I admit liking my GUI and mouse

2016-03-15 08:35:32	zmoylan-pi	i honestly think the 3a had a better keyboard than the 5.  the way the battery in hinge moves down to raise the keyboard made it possible to grip the psion while walking so you couldn't drop it and type at 30wpm
2016-03-15 08:36:18	james_olympus	It's similar to some calculators
2016-03-15 08:37:10	zmoylan-pi	i really wish they still made them. a psion with wifi and a beefier processor would be very nice
2016-03-15 08:38:09	zmoylan-pi	still haven't seen software on pc or cloud like agenda that would allow me to set up repeating appointments on 3rd friday of every 2nd month

2016-03-15 09:23:31	popey	no idea
2016-03-15 09:23:37	popey	Ioangogo: yes, many years ago
2016-03-15 09:23:52	popey	I have an account and only login when people mention it
2016-03-15 09:23:57	popey	which is maybe once every few months
2016-03-15 09:24:04	ChibaPet	Diaspora died long ago I think.
2016-03-15 09:24:19	ChibaPet	They made a big noise and begged for a bunch of money and ended up not actually having any software.
2016-03-15 09:24:21	popey	they put a release out last week
2016-03-15 09:24:28	popey	no, the software exists
2016-03-15 09:24:38	ChibaPet	Hrm. That's interesting then.
2016-03-15 09:24:47	popey	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(software)
2016-03-15 09:25:18	Ioangogo	ChibaPet: Its got a bit better reciently, a person signed up 2 days ago on my node who had python in their intrests
2016-03-15 09:25:30	popey	heh
2016-03-15 09:25:33	popey	"a person"
2016-03-15 09:25:37	Ioangogo	I might remove the intrests though
2016-03-15 09:25:39	popey	vs facebook - billion or so
2016-03-15 09:25:43	Ioangogo	Just gets spammy
2016-03-15 09:26:30	Ioangogo	popey: I think it is a neat idea, just need people who will use
2016-03-15 09:26:31	Ioangogo	it
2016-03-15 09:26:36	ChibaPet	Alright, that wikipedia entry shows a sufficiently vigorous release cycle.
2016-03-15 09:26:55	Ioangogo	shared it with a bunch or reditors scared of facebook spying
2016-03-15 09:26:58	popey	diaspora lost out to those with deep pockets and first-mover advantage
2016-03-15 09:27:45	Ioangogo	The wikipedia page need a bit of care
2016-03-15 09:28:41	ChibaPet	For a time I was working out ideas for a distributed point-to-point social network that'd support privacy (anonymity and encryption) but then I realized that email was sufficient.
2016-03-15 09:30:00	Ioangogo	Its old and broken though
2016-03-15 09:30:10	Ioangogo	Though more people have it
2016-03-15 09:30:52	ChibaPet	Bah, it's not broken.
2016-03-15 09:31:12	Ioangogo	spoofing
2016-03-15 09:31:17	ChibaPet	TLS
2016-03-15 09:31:29	Ioangogo	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email#Problems
2016-03-15 09:32:37	ChibaPet	Privacy concerns are valid with everyone using Google.
2016-03-15 09:32:55	ChibaPet	It would be a healthier world if many, many more people had private mail servers.
2016-03-15 09:33:58	Ioangogo	I like the twitter like feel of diaspora
2016-03-15 09:35:21	ChibaPet	Bah, I'm not remembering the name of the FSF-backed software now...
2016-03-15 09:35:37	Ioangogo	Urgh, I still havent worked out how to use PGP effecently
2016-03-15 09:35:56	ChibaPet	I can use it efficiently but I don't. I need to start again.
2016-03-15 09:36:36	Ioangogo	Well, i use open key chain on my phone, but havent found a good tool for my desktop
2016-03-15 09:37:55	ChibaPet	Found it. http://www.indenti.ca/
2016-03-15 09:38:41	ChibaPet	(and https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/fsf-identica-groups)
2016-03-15 09:39:12	ChibaPet	Hm, and http://status.fsf.org/ (status.net) is evidently still alive.
2016-03-15 09:39:58	Ioangogo	I had a look at that once, But does it work between diffrent sites
2016-03-15 09:40:10	Ioangogo	:P
2016-03-15 09:40:31	swift110	hey Ioangogo and ChibaPet
2016-03-15 09:40:36	ChibaPet	o/
2016-03-15 09:41:00	Ioangogo	ChibaPet: Does GNU Social have a way to talk between instances
2016-03-15 09:41:02	ChibaPet	In other news, I'm mostly giving up on high-DPI support on my MacBook running Ubuntu.
2016-03-15 09:41:39	ChibaPet	Ioangogo: I *believe* so. It's based on status.net.
2016-03-15 09:42:03	Ioangogo	Yeah, i have a account on load advrage
2016-03-15 09:42:24	ChibaPet	So, I'm cheating now: xrandr --output eDP1 --mode 1280x800
2016-03-15 09:42:37	Ioangogo	Ohh, i rembered my login
2016-03-15 09:43:21	ChibaPet	I think I need to try Unity again, and see if I can stomach it.
2016-03-15 09:43:27	Ioangogo	Yeah, it does support diffrent ones
2016-03-15 09:43:31	Ioangogo	I like gnome 3
2016-03-15 09:43:48	ChibaPet	Gnome 3 uses a TON of vertical space. Those titlebars!
2016-03-15 09:44:07	Ioangogo	ChibaPet: whats your screen size?
2016-03-15 09:44:22	ChibaPet	Ioangogo: native 2560x1600, it's a macbook11,1
2016-03-15 09:44:23	blahdeblah	ChibaPet: Make sure you install Unity Tweak Tool and Compiz Config Settings Manager; between those two I managed to get Unity to a point where I prefer it to GNOME 2, which I never thought I would say.
2016-03-15 09:44:44	ChibaPet	blahdeblah: Can I reclaim my alt key for my own use?
2016-03-15 09:45:21	ChibaPet	I'm running Openbox now, but I'm willing to try to be open-minded, just a little.
2016-03-15 09:45:21	blahdeblah	ChibaPet: I don't know about that specifically (I haven't tried), but there's quite a lot of keyboard customisation that can be done.

2016-03-16 08:53:43	mcphail	I've squeezed the last drop from the Macallan Gold bottle. On my shelf is a Tomatin Legacy, a Benromach, a Royal Lochnagar and an Old Pulteney. Which one gets opened?

2016-03-16 08:56:13	mcphail	indeed

2016-03-16 09:04:53	badders	nice for some - I can't seem to keep ales around for more than a few hours at a time, it seems
2016-03-16 09:05:49	mcphail	Buy in bulk. It is the only way to be safe.
2016-03-16 09:06:34	huw	there's always gin in my cupboard \o/
2016-03-16 09:06:55	mcphail	Gin? Best place for it
2016-03-16 09:07:26	huw	better than whisky
2016-03-16 09:09:19	mcphail	I jest. Gin is fine. Apparently Scotland is producing more gin than single malt these days
2016-03-16 09:11:41	mcphail	Was given this in a posh restaurant recently - http://www.nbgin.com/ - quite a nice drop
2016-03-16 09:12:01	huw	apparently it's on the rise, yeah
2016-03-16 09:12:14	huw	personally i drink it because it's the only spirit i can really stomach any more
2016-03-16 09:12:29	huw	got fed up of nothing but beer all the time :)
2016-03-16 09:13:41	mcphail	I know what you mean. I have to treat the whisky with a bit of respect these days
2016-03-16 09:14:28	huw	i *wish* i could drink whisky, but i just can't any more. just the smell of it makes me queasy :(
2016-03-16 09:17:02	mcphail	Try a small measure of a decent malt in a Glencairn glass with a couple of drops of water to kill the evapourating alcohol (which carries some of the rougher smells). You might change your mind

2016-03-16 20:36:12	popey	degville: I discovered this week that if you run your system with no swap, and memory pressure gets too much, kswapd will eat your cpu alive as it tries to "swap" and make your computer completely unusable! :)

2016-03-17 03:21:24	jimbotux	Joanna Cherry was the MP who really stood up and asked the serious questions imo. But as you say they abstained. To me that just reeks of them wanting the bill to pass while acting as if they wan the opposite

2016-03-17 20:53:17	Devilment	Paul Daniels has died
2016-03-17 20:53:32	Devilment	I wonder if they'll saw the coffin in two at the funeral?
2016-03-17 20:57:45	Stilvoid	start the service with: you'll like this... not a lot
2016-03-17 20:58:31	zmoylan-pi	no magicians have a ritual were they break the wand of the magician over the grave at their funerals.  sounds quite nice tbh
2016-03-17 20:59:38	Devilment	Will they close the coffin lid, reopen it to find he's disappeared then open another coffin with him in it?
2016-03-17 21:01:58	Devilment	What's the lead time these days on a celebrity dying and accusations of improper behaviour?
2016-03-17 21:02:26	zmoylan-pi	depends if they worked for the bbc or not i think
2016-03-17 21:02:52	@degville	(i'm at least trying hard not to laugh )

2016-03-17 23:47:47	TraceyC	yay, I can listen to it on the drive home :D
2016-03-17 23:48:17	TraceyC	Hearing all the informative news & the giggling makes the drive more pleasant
2016-03-17 23:48:46	einonm	degville: Thanks! I think the website is alittle wrong though - it's advertising season 2, ep. 16 at the top of the front page
2016-03-17 23:49:14	einonm	..and the picture link is to 2.15
2016-03-17 23:50:07	einonm	no..wait...the link is 2.16, but the picture link on 2.16 is to 2.15...
2016-03-17 23:50:09	@degville	not the RSS? Just linuxvoice.com? Weird.
2016-03-17 23:50:34	einonm	yes, RSS looks fine, the frontpage doesn't
2016-03-17 23:50:43	@degville	I'm sure it looks ok to me, but I could be missing something. Unless it's cloudflare.
2016-03-17 23:51:25	einonm	ah..wait...turned on some more javascript - it now works, but that's a subtle error!
2016-03-17 23:52:03	TraceyC	BUG
2016-03-17 23:52:22	@degville	ok, thanks. Mmm.. may have to look into what's happening.
2016-03-17 23:52:34	TraceyC	blame the javascript

2016-03-17 23:53:42	einonm	degville: Actually, the image link still looks wrong?

2016-03-17 23:53:58	einonm	pointing at https://www.linuxvoice.com/podcast-season-2-episode-16/ for me
2016-03-17 23:54:21	mcphail	TraceyC: I think we're winning that one. At least your country seems to care about privacy
2016-03-17 23:54:26	zmoylan-pi	england killed a queen by intercepting and decoding her mail back in 16th century so uk wins
2016-03-17 23:54:47	TraceyC	I'm seeing S4 Ep 5 on the home page
2016-03-17 23:54:55	zmoylan-pi	you think they stopped after that?
2016-03-17 23:55:03	TraceyC	Try clearing cache, that's usually the cause when I see old stuff on a page and others see the new stuff
2016-03-17 23:55:04	@degville	einonm: it's a weird problem. I'm seeing S4 Ep 5 too.
2016-03-17 23:55:15	TraceyC	(Chromium here)
2016-03-17 23:56:03	TraceyC	and I see the link https://www.linuxvoice.com/podcast-season-4-episode-5/

2016-03-18 05:55:31	Mihaly	I seem to be attracting females tonight - there's a huntsman spider sitting not far from my corner just above me. I keep looking up
2016-03-18 05:55:58	Mihaly	expecting it to vanish and then I willgo argh -where did it go>
2016-03-18 06:00:35	Mihaly	but it just is sitting there, I noticed it outside earlier, tried to tell it to stay outside, but somehow I just knew it would come into my room. is it following me or the fleas?
2016-03-18 06:03:10	Mihaly	its about 10 cm from leg to leg, and i don't know why I find it so scary, but it's odd i think that I didn;t notice it creeping up on me

2016-03-18 06:13:42	TraceyC	True story - one evening, I was sitting in the kitchen with my boyfriend and we heard this weird scraping sound. We identified it as some bug / spider leg scratching through the wee crack around the cover for the light fixture (where it attaches to the ceiling)
2016-03-18 06:14:02	Mihaly	anyway, as dawn approaches it is likely to just hang there
2016-03-18 06:14:03	TraceyC	The spider was in the ceiling, trying to scrape a leg through to the other side
2016-03-18 06:14:51	Mihaly	they do scrape presumably to ensure cleanliness of their leg spideriness. was it ahuntsman?
2016-03-18 06:16:23	Mihaly	also maybe the loudness was due to accoustic reflections in the light fixture
2016-03-18 06:18:47	Mihaly	ok give me a few moments, I'll transfer the image of it as is
2016-03-18 06:21:03	Mihaly	did that work?
2016-03-18 06:21:58	zmoylan-pi	some irc clients accept transfers, others do not.  best bet is to post on imgur and post link
2016-03-18 06:23:03	Mihaly	Yeah, it's ok. never mind, I should post it on my facebook. Whats imgur? sounds like a mediteranian

2016-03-18 06:29:38	zmoylan-pi	gone to get it's mates...
2016-03-18 06:30:30	Mihaly	no, it isn't here to seek for mates, it's here to seek somewhere where someone won't spray it or squash it.
2016-03-18 06:30:46	Mihaly	but haha of course, yeah
2016-03-18 06:35:14	Mihaly	there's the entire place it could go, but it followed to me, my room. arggh why

2016-03-18 06:47:55	zmoylan-pi	1947 in ireland
2016-03-18 06:48:07	TraceyC	lol
2016-03-18 06:48:18	TraceyC	near 3p in central US
2016-03-18 06:48:49	TraceyC	There are those trying to get us back to 1947 but they haven't succeeded yet
2016-03-18 06:51:46	zmoylan-pi	well you have all the time in the world to perfect your time machine...
2016-03-18 06:51:54	TraceyC	right?
2016-03-18 06:52:06	TraceyC	What do we want? Time travel! When do we want it? Irrelevant!
2016-03-18 06:52:44	zmoylan-pi	i believe the correct grammar is 'when willen we want it?'

2016-03-18 06:56:01	zmoylan-pi	if hitch hikers and life of brian has done nothing, it has taught us valuable lessons in grammar :-)
2016-03-18 06:56:05	Mihaly	I willen would have wanted it when it was near but now it's here I only watch antiques roadshow like caspar last

2016-03-18 07:24:40	Arthur_D	didn't get my old Raspberry Pi model B working today either, so yeah it wasn't just a fluke those years back. Oh well
2016-03-18 07:25:05	Arthur_D	probably faulty hardware from the get-go
2016-03-18 07:26:43	Arthur_D	I guess I could try getting a RPi 3 but I don't really have much to do with it
2016-03-18 07:28:08	Mihaly	still trying to actually work out why those circuit boards are worth getting into?
2016-03-18 07:29:13	Arthur_D	sorta
2016-03-18 07:29:37	Arthur_D	I mean I have two desktop computers already :)
2016-03-18 07:29:46	*	zmoylan-pi has a pi b running a couple of years now.  great little machine.  use it for irc/rss and a few other tasks about the house
2016-03-18 07:30:25	Mihaly	i still recall uni days - we used to laugh about calling it a BBQ, but I acknowledge we burnt some expensive 64000
2016-03-18 07:30:30	zmoylan-pi	a little box running on a phone charger in the kitchen i can log into from any machine in the house so i'm on irc 24x7 instead of expensive power hungry beast
2016-03-18 07:30:35	Arthur_D	yep, could use it for irc, but I just set up znc on my VPS a few days ago

2016-03-18 07:31:13	Mihaly	are ARM chips anything like a 64000 chip? assembly wise?
2016-03-18 07:31:35	Mihaly	i should say 68000 :}\\
2016-03-18 07:34:26	Mihaly	i still have my old uni book assembler 68040 -n
2016-03-18 07:35:06	Arthur_D	naw man you use Python nowadays ;)
2016-03-18 07:36:19	Mihaly	it's wierd though, I really wanted to actually pass that course - we used forth, ànd baked the chip every time
2016-03-18 07:36:47	Arthur_D	baked chip cookies? Yum
2016-03-18 07:37:45	Mihaly	it always seemed we realeased the magic smoke, test to destruction. No wonder I failed - consistently
2016-03-18 07:38:22	Arthur_D	speaking of, I heard the RPi 3 gets quite hot
2016-03-18 07:39:05	Arthur_D	presumably under high load, so if it runs something light it wouldn't matter
2016-03-18 07:39:20	Mihaly	wouldn't know - though I would like to get my hands on one, or even an earlier version]
2016-03-18 07:47:54	popey	I have had a Pi3 in my PiCade, been playing games and other things that would cause it to get hot, and it's been fine
2016-03-18 07:47:59	popey	no cooling in that box either
2016-03-18 07:49:13	Arthur_D	ok, sounds like not an issue then, good :)

2016-03-22 08:25:10	ChibaPet	I won't spoil it, but there'll be a quiz afterwards to see if you catch all the different ways the concept of piracy shows up in different parts of the show. :P

2016-03-25 20:36:59	TwistedLucidity	Actaully, that's not a bad idea. Wonder if the antenna can be attached?

2016-03-25 20:44:34	Devilment	I think they're too locked down to be reflashable
2016-03-25 20:44:50	Devilment	But a R-Pi case would be interesting
2016-03-25 20:45:03	Devilment	It'd have decent OS inside it for once

2016-03-25 21:09:06	TwistedLucidity	Devilment: Probably right, and I could never attach it to VM again. But if it was flashable (say with OpenWRT) I could use it to experiment on without fear.
2016-03-25 21:09:34	TwistedLucidity	If that fails, I 'll go down to the Hackspace and attach it with a Dremel (other grinding tools are available)

2016-03-26 00:05:56	zmoylan-pi	my dumbphone is at 75% since last night when i forgot to charge it and although i know it's grand i keep wanting to charge it to 100%...
2016-03-26 00:10:45	TraceyC	I can relate
2016-03-26 00:11:05	TraceyC	For me it partially stems from the days when you had to charge your dumb phone 2 - 3 times a day to keep it alive
2016-03-26 00:11:20	 *	TraceyC does not miss having to have a car charger
2016-03-26 00:11:40	zmoylan-pi	my god, what sort of crappy phones were you using? motorola?
2016-03-26 00:11:49	TraceyC	One of them was, yes
2016-03-26 00:12:06	TraceyC	Later on I had a small samsung flip phone that could keep a charge for about 3 - 5 days
2016-03-26 00:12:11	zmoylan-pi	american phones... ick...
2016-03-26 00:12:15	TraceyC	yeah
2016-03-26 00:12:45	TraceyC	I've read stories that had a theme of "Hey you in the US, look at the type of phones they have in Japan and realize that what you have is what they tossed in the skip years ago"
2016-03-26 00:12:54	zmoylan-pi	a mate had a motorola smart tac... battery life of minutes... i had a nokia 3310 then... almost indestructible... and great battery
2016-03-26 00:13:24	corsack	and most importantly you could play snake :)
2016-03-26 00:13:31	TraceyC	they were solid. Only issue I ever saw was the Nokia freezing from time to time, necessitating yanking the battery
2016-03-26 00:13:34	zmoylan-pi	forever and ever...

2016-03-29 07:03:48	einonm	This is something I'm genuinely excited about - the software suite that studio ghibli use for 2D animation has just been open sourced, and on github https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz
2016-03-29 07:04:30	einonm	no linux version yet, but there looks to be plenty of people trying to port it
2016-03-29 07:05:13	Ioangogo	Im going to read one of my pairents old books on operating system conspets
2016-03-29 07:05:47	Ioangogo	einonm: im downloading it on my windows gaming machine
2016-03-29 07:07:18	Ioangogo	thats strange, it wanted fire wall accsess
2016-03-29 07:08:23	Ioangogo	and it installs to c:\opentoonz stuff\
2016-03-29 07:10:33	einonm	I don;t have a windows machine, but I'm not too bothered about that - I also have no drawings to scan :) but I think it's great for open source
2016-03-29 07:10:58	M1C4HTRON13	looks like ideasman42 (blender dev) is working on the post
2016-03-29 07:12:41	M1C4HTRON13	Krita getting animation as well means there's gona be a bunch of 2D options on linux now
2016-03-29 07:15:03	einonm	Ioangogo: Tannenbaum?
2016-03-29 07:15:17	Ioangogo	einonm: ?
2016-03-29 07:15:40	james_olympus	At university, we used to call it 'The Book'
2016-03-29 07:15:46	einonm	operating system books. Usually the one most people use
2016-03-29 07:17:11	james_olympus	Actually, to avoid ambiguity with the other Tanenbaum, we called it 'The Other Book', 'Structured Computer Organisation' was 'The Book'

2016-03-29 19:00:15	Korruptor	I'd like something for when I'm giving lectures, just plug it in for the presentation, use the convergence aspects on the train to do a bit of work, not have a heavy bag to carry around
2016-03-29 19:00:41	Korruptor	wish it had a slightly meatier gpu tho
2016-03-29 19:01:48	arubislander	Hold out for the next gen tablet then I suppose. If the phones are anything to go by, the next one out will have better specs.
2016-03-29 19:01:58	Korruptor	that's what I was thinking
2016-03-29 19:02:41	Korruptor	but if I had the cash I'd probably get this just to support the idea of linux on a tablet

2016-03-29 19:07:10	arubislander	BQ seams like a good company. I bought the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition from them. And it was interesting to see the OS progress with every update...

2016-03-29 19:12:49	zmoylan-pi	sounds like every other mobile os then.. :-)
2016-03-29 19:13:17	arubislander	:-D
2016-03-29 19:14:10	zmoylan-pi	well... of course except for windows mobile os which leaves out the happy part... :-P
2016-03-29 19:15:07	TwistedLucidity	arubislander: Going to wait for a few reviews...it's a lot of money to through at something unknown.
2016-03-29 19:15:37	mcphail	My wife's laptop managed to trick her into "upgrading" to windows 10 last week. It is hard to believe a modern operating system could be worse than Windows 8, but, credit to MS, they have achieved it
2016-03-29 19:16:24	mcphail	Using windows on a phone must be excruciating
2016-03-29 19:17:01	zmoylan-pi	an accountant was complaining to me over the weekend that she went into work last week and found windows 10 waiting for her with no indication or prompt... she wasted over a day rolling back to previous os
2016-03-29 19:18:13	arubislander	This also will pass... the next iteration of Windows will surely be a Linux distro given the way MS is going... Maybe that is their strategy. Slowly morph the OS into Linux without alerting the user...
2016-03-29 19:18:14	mcphail	T'wife can't remember actually accepting the Win10 upgrade. I think it might have been bundled with the routine upgrades this time (i.e. you'd have to check what was queued and opt-out)
2016-03-29 19:19:06	zmoylan-pi	they made windows 10 'recommended' which installed it on a lot of systems for people who didn't want it
2016-03-29 19:20:21	mcphail	that'll be it, then. Evil behaviour
2016-03-29 19:20:23	zmoylan-pi	and ms cannot sell a linux distro.  opens them to lawsuits as they signed a deal when they sold xenix never to sell unix again
2016-03-29 19:21:50	arubislander	Really? I was not aware of that...
2016-03-29 19:22:24	Korruptor	sell or distribute?
2016-03-29 19:22:42	Korruptor	they're not really selling win10 at this point, just ramming it down people's face holes.
2016-03-29 19:23:06	zmoylan-pi	either way lawyers would be all over them
2016-03-29 19:24:21	TwistedLucidity	mcphail: Win10 is auto-opt-in. It also destroys data; check that every application still works and that no files/details have been lost.
2016-03-29 19:25:02	TwistedLucidity	zmoylan-pi: Luckily Linux is not Unix. And neither is GNU!
2016-03-29 19:25:32	zmoylan-pi	well it isn't and it also is...
2016-03-29 19:25:34	mcphail	TwistedLucidity: happily, the laptop is only really used for watching netflix and DVDs.
2016-03-29 19:26:16	zmoylan-pi	the unix market back then was so fragmented that it was all about posix compatibility... isn't linux posix compliant?
2016-03-29 19:29:15	Devilment	Nope, Linux is not POSIX compliant
2016-03-29 19:29:47	Korruptor	quick question, does anyone here play games through steam? If so are you 32bit linux or 64bit linux?
2016-03-29 19:30:04	Devilment	IIRC, you can pass switches to various GNU utilities to make them POSIX-y
2016-03-29 19:31:30	Devilment	I installed Steam on my 64-bix CentOS desktop. I was able to play Prison Architect
2016-03-29 19:31:41	Devilment	But that's the extent of my testing
2016-03-29 19:31:55	Korruptor	yeah, I'm on 64bit linux as well
2016-03-29 19:32:17	Korruptor	I'm just polling to see how necessary it is to deliver a 32bit version of Lumo over steam (because I can't test it)

2016-03-29 19:34:10	mcphail	Korruptor: 32 bit games run fine on supported 64 bit steam platforms (steam os and Ubuntu)
2016-03-29 19:34:26	Korruptor	nah, Lumo's 64bit atm
2016-03-29 19:34:58	Korruptor	I can build 32bit but can't test it on 32bit iyswim
2016-03-29 19:35:25	Korruptor	just curious if anyone running 32bit actually plays new games :D
2016-03-29 19:37:14	mcphail	Korruptor: I'm sure I have seen some grumbling about 64bit-only games on IRC, but suspect those are a vocal minority
2016-03-29 19:37:53	Korruptor	honestly not sure what the best option is, might put out a universal and just hope it works on 32bit
2016-03-29 19:37:55	TwistedLucidity	Korruptor: 64bit here. Tend not to launch via Steam, just use that to grab updates.
2016-03-29 19:38:17	Korruptor	TwistedLucidity, yeah, that's kinda what I do as well
2016-03-29 19:38:25	popey	Korruptor: i use steam on 64-bit but I have the 32-bit libs installed
2016-03-29 19:38:40	popey	you have to as steam is 32-bit as are the vast majority of games
2016-03-29 19:39:05	einonm	Linus is pretty much POSIX compliant as far as I know, it just doesn't have the POSIX accreditation, 'cos that costs money.
2016-03-29 19:39:08	einonm	..Linux
2016-03-29 19:39:09	mcphail	popey: the steam runtime provides the libs anyway, and most games use the steam runtime
2016-03-29 19:39:26	popey	no, i mean the steam UI itself
2016-03-29 19:39:29	Korruptor	popey, yeah, steam ui is 32bit
2016-03-29 19:39:36	TwistedLucidity	Korruptor: You could always release the 32bit as "best effort". Would mean having to deal with any bugs people raise though. Biggest issue I've had with 32bits is people not linking libraries properly and hiding the details on what version so what libraries are needed.
2016-03-29 19:39:55	TwistedLucidity	Usually you can find the answers in the forums related to the game/supplier though.
2016-03-29 19:40:02	mcphail	Korruptor: is your game made on Unity? I thought all Unity games were 32bit?
2016-03-29 19:40:11	Korruptor	it's an odd one because Unity's linux support is god awful
2016-03-29 19:40:12	popey	unity can spit out 32 and 64-bit binaries
2016-03-29 19:40:17	Korruptor	64bit is stable
2016-03-29 19:40:19	mcphail	aah
2016-03-29 19:40:26	Korruptor	32bit looks basically unsupported at this stage
2016-03-29 19:40:46	Korruptor	OpenGL core has numerous crashes in and probably needs to be launched via a custom launcher, which I don't want to do
2016-03-29 19:40:54	popey	Korruptor: why can't you test 32-bit version of Lumo?
2016-03-29 19:41:17	Korruptor	I can test it on a 64bit install of Ubuntu, but I don't have a machine to sacrifice to test it on a 32bit install of Ubuntu
2016-03-29 19:41:58	popey	i know liam from gaming on linux often tests stuff for people :)
2016-03-29 19:42:00	Korruptor	so I'm just sniffing about to see what people tend to run, lazy option is to just ship 64bit, one I'm doing atm is to ship universal but cross fingers
2016-03-29 19:42:27	Korruptor	ok, might give him a shout
2016-03-29 19:42:33	popey	surely you could just boot a live 32-bit cd?
2016-03-29 19:42:38	popey	and run it off that
2016-03-29 19:42:48	Korruptor	that's not a solid enough test
2016-03-29 19:43:08	Korruptor	tbh I'd need a bunch of setups
2016-03-29 19:43:25	Korruptor	which I've done for the 64bit as everyone I know runs it :D
2016-03-29 19:44:01	popey	haha, someone in the jolla channel received their tablet, and they're now being offered refunds.
2016-03-29 19:44:05	popey	no wonder jolla have no money
2016-03-29 19:44:07	mcphail	Korruptor: I think there was a phoronix or gamingonlinux poll recently which suggested 32bit users were rare beasts
2016-03-29 19:44:31	Korruptor	oh, really? *goes to the googles*

2016-03-29 19:59:56	Korruptor	Tbh, everyone I asked permission from to use something in Lumo said yes. Was very cool.

2016-03-29 20:06:07	popey	didn't realise that was intentional

2016-03-29 20:06:26	popey	i recall they changed it, was originally Zob
2016-03-29 20:06:38	Korruptor	the original was never finished, so they're putting in all the stuff they wanted to the first time around
2016-03-29 20:06:42	popey	the Speccy loading screen very clearly had the top of the O rubbed out to make it Zub
2016-03-29 20:06:58	Korruptor	yeah, could well be

2016-04-07 18:00:23	Devilment	Well, that was annoying last night
2016-04-07 18:01:31	Devilment	£340 bid on a Lenovo X250 laptop, starting price £244
2016-04-07 18:01:31		[18:01]
2016-04-07 18:01:39	Devilment	Actually won it for £244
2016-04-07 18:02:00	Devilment	Paid the seller only for him to refund me a couple of hours later

2016-04-07 18:02:40	Devilment	His excuse was he'd installed Ubuntu Linux on it and had muffed up the Windows recovery partition
2016-04-07 18:02:52	Devilment	And that he couldn't sell it in good faith
2016-04-07 18:03:03	Devilment	Bollocks, says I
2016-04-07 18:03:22	Devilment	Probably because he didn't get as much for it as he wanted
2016-04-07 18:04:04	Devilment	I shot him a reply saying I was going to install Fedora Linux so lack of  Windows recovery is not a problem
2016-04-07 18:04:48	Devilment	He's getting negative feedback if he doesn't reply by this evening
2016-04-07 18:10:00		[18:04]
2016-04-07 18:15:23	james_olympus	He should have set the starting bid or the reserve, then
2016-04-07 18:16:32	Devilment	Yep

2016-04-07 18:33:26	james_olympus	So he's probably done you a favour by removing the recovery partition
2016-04-07 18:37:48	Devilment	michaelis: That's a non-issue as far as I'm concerend
2016-04-07 18:38:47	michaelis	Devilment: No, of course not. It's just a side track which I came to think of when I heard lenovo. Of course his excuse is bad.

2016-04-07 23:10:01	Devilment	I blame Mike
2016-04-07 23:10:08	@degville	Can we all please blame Mike.
2016-04-07 23:10:18	@degville	It was Mike's fault.
2016-04-07 23:10:22	JoeRess	#blamepopey
2016-04-07 23:10:39	JoeRess	Now there's a blast from the past
2016-04-07 23:10:42	@degville	errr. I'll tweet it for now. And there's definitely an ad in the issue we're just finishing. but yeah, sorry.
2016-04-07 23:10:52	JoeRess	It's OK
2016-04-07 23:10:57	Devilment	Mike should've done it as his "Just one more thing(tm)"
2016-04-07 23:11:21	JoeRess	As I said my concern is that it will sell out before your listeners hear about it
2016-04-07 23:11:22	popey	wise
2016-04-07 23:11:58	popey	JoeRess: sadly #blamepopey still has legs http://blamepopey.com/
2016-04-07 23:12:02	popey	(not my website)
2016-04-07 23:12:14	 *	TraceyC blames mike
2016-04-07 23:13:04	JoeRess	Is it normal to change the font colour in your terminal to green so it looks like the Matrix?
2016-04-07 23:13:19	popey	in 2016, less so I think
2016-04-07 23:13:50	TraceyC	that.. would only be the 2nd time in my life I've been genuinely RickRolled & didn't see it coming. Well played. (http://blamepopey.com/)
2016-04-07 23:13:56	popey	hah
2016-04-07 23:14:09	zmoylan-pi	my first terminal experince was green text on black then gold text on the fancy new terminals
2016-04-07 23:14:16	TraceyC	Same
2016-04-07 23:14:37	popey	amusingly the guy who made that site sent a mail about his broken mx4 to the ubuntu phone mailing list and the issues he's having. He posted the link and _nobody_ clicked it but continued to reply to his mail to help solve the problem :)
2016-04-07 23:14:51	TraceyC	I learned 2 computer on my mom's TRS-80. She taught me word processing after having converted her company's donor list to a database
2016-04-07 23:15:15	popey	https://lists.launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone/msg19253.html
2016-04-07 23:15:40	popey	Yeah, first terminal I used was on a Pr1meOS mini-computer at Brooklands College in 1986
2016-04-07 23:15:43	popey	was green.
2016-04-07 23:16:53	popey	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer#/media/File:Prime9950_kean.jpg
2016-04-07 23:16:55	popey	happy memories
2016-04-07 23:17:36	popey	learned COBOL on that.
2016-04-07 23:17:49	TwistedLucidity	TraceyC: Took me an age to see it - evil Flash is blocked
2016-04-07 23:18:41	Devilment	*Gasp* Another COBOL dinosaur in here

2016-04-07 23:19:15	TwistedLucidity	I am really sorry if I screwed your current accounts or mortgagegs up....
2016-04-07 23:19:19	Devilment	TwistedLucidity: Just like the programs
2016-04-07 23:19:38	Devilment	There's no such thing as a short COBOL program
2016-04-07 23:20:18	Korruptor	I learned COBOL at college as well, still recovering
2016-04-07 23:21:19	Devilment	JoeRess: www.asty.org/cmatrix/ for the full effect
2016-04-07 23:21:42	TwistedLucidity	Devilment: Good money in COBOL I'm told.
2016-04-07 23:22:02	Korruptor	and ADA
2016-04-07 23:23:00	TwistedLucidity	Isn't ADA for dropping bombs on people's heads? At least with COBOL you only defraud them
2016-04-07 23:23:22	Korruptor	yeah, I think MOD are the main users
2016-04-07 23:23:28	Korruptor	got taught that as well
2016-04-07 23:23:54	Korruptor	but since there are like 3 people that can still write it, and lots of dodgy sw that needs porting there's a fair bit of cash in it
2016-04-07 23:24:40	popey	COBOL was mostly responsible for wasting printer paper where I was. Not much productive.
2016-04-07 23:24:40		[23:24]
2016-04-07 23:25:14	Korruptor	very verbose, I'll give it that
2016-04-07 23:25:33	Stilvoid	Any AS/400 weirdos?
2016-04-07 23:25:47	james_olympus	I have a lot of old paper with sprocket holes.  Maybe I could open a chip shop
2016-04-07 23:26:25	Korruptor	that the paper with the green and white stripes?
2016-04-07 23:26:31	james_olympus	Yes
2016-04-07 23:26:39	Korruptor	god I used to think I was NERD GOD printing out source to that
2016-04-07 23:27:30	Korruptor	don't even own a printer now
2016-04-07 23:27:59	james_olympus	I only use mine for postage labels (they used to be called 'stamps')
2016-04-07 23:28:42	Devilment	Colour laser printers and syntax highlighting FTW
2016-04-07 23:28:53	 *	Korruptor looks at rogue one trailer

2016-04-08 00:05:45	Devilment	I think Ep VII was JJ saying to the fan base, "We understand this."

2016-04-08 00:07:38	Korruptor	but tbh, it's hard to go wrong when you're merging the stories from the 3 good star wars and giving everything a decent lick of paint

2016-04-08 00:24:20	TwistedLucidity	Biggest issue for me was that it was episodes 4. For the third time.
2016-04-08 00:25:01	TwistedLucidity	The characters were good though. But "Deathstar V3.0 - this time we're serious"?
2016-04-08 00:25:41	TwistedLucidity	There were also a few too many nods to the proper films. One or two would have been OK, but towards the end I was wondering if he was capable of forming an original idea.
2016-04-08 00:25:51	Devilment	Hold on, has everyone here who wants to see SW VII seen it yet before we delve too far into spoilers?
2016-04-08 00:26:19	TraceyC	I agree, too many nods to the previous films. I did appreciate the lack of stupid characters tho
2016-04-08 00:27:00	TwistedLucidity	Oooo....he could have killed JarJar. I'd have watched that on repeat
2016-04-08 00:27:09	Devilment	OK, no-one objects. Plough on
2016-04-08 00:27:33	Devilment	I liked that Kylo Ren looked like the school spanner

2016-04-08 01:09:46	TwistedLucidity	Which will be rejected because of Catalunya

2016-04-08 01:22:19	TwistedLucidity	Korruptor: See, that's the thing. Catalunya wants to split from Spain and would most likely seek EU membership. Madrid would want to block that and a stick to keep the Catalans in-line.
2016-04-08 01:22:36	Korruptor	yeah, I know
2016-04-08 01:22:44	TwistedLucidity	Allowing Scotland to join the EU after splitting would set a precedent Madrid would not want, so they'd try to block Scotland
2016-04-08 01:22:59	Korruptor	but there's a very fuzzy line with the EU, it's technically illegal to leave, and both "have membership"
2016-04-08 01:23:02	TwistedLucidity	How much power Madrid has in the EU....I dunno. They sure hold a lot of debt though!
2016-04-08 01:23:16	Korruptor	yeah, it needs arbitration

2016-04-11 19:04:23	@degville	Morning. Thanks mcphail. I don't think you rambled popey.
2016-04-11 19:06:40	ideasman42	degville, \o, not sure if it was you who mentioned - but theres a WIP linux port of opentoonz
2016-04-11 19:07:11	ideasman42	https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz/pull/51
2016-04-11 19:07:36	@degville	Excellent!! Thanks! I've not been able to check recently, but I'll give it a go now. Have you tried it?

2016-04-11 19:07:51	ideasman42	I've been working on the port
2016-04-11 19:07:57	ideasman42	(thats my pr :) )
2016-04-11 19:08:00	@degville	aha!!
2016-04-11 19:08:05	@degville	awesome! Thanks!
2016-04-11 19:08:10	ideasman42	I've also been in contact with the original developers
2016-04-11 19:08:27	ideasman42	and they're going to be basing their commercial version on the open one
2016-04-11 19:08:43	ideasman42	Which was something not entirely clear from the press release
2016-04-11 19:09:22	ideasman42	So, its not totally clear what happens... But it seems like opentoonz will be working on Linux eventually
2016-04-11 19:09:34	ideasman42	(by next release at a guess)
2016-04-11 19:12:31	@degville	That's really good news. We'll definitely cover this, especially for this next issue.
2016-04-11 19:13:21	ideasman42	degville, ok. ping me if you have any Q's - however current version - while it loads and you can draw... I dont think is really usable
2016-04-11 19:13:33	ideasman42	its more `alpha` level
2016-04-11 19:13:56	ideasman42	and I dont have time for really supporting it, was only weekend challange
2016-04-11 19:13:56		[19:13]
2016-04-11 19:14:20	@degville	yep, that's ok. I understood the amount of work that needed to be done. I'll make sure we're clear.
2016-04-11 19:14:33	ideasman42	so hopefully community of more focused devs becomes active

2016-04-11 22:48:19	@degville	hello towy71 - no, I don't think so, although we tried something similar over a year ago. Is it WebRTC? We had found that it worked well for 2-3 but started to fall over at 4+ people.
2016-04-11 22:48:30	@degville	We should give it a go though.

2016-04-12 19:11:36	arubislander	Anyhow... I have just downloaded Beru, the ebook reader app on the Ubuntu store. And I must say, reading the epub version of Linux Voice on it is a very pleasant experience...

2016-04-12 19:19:33	Arthur_D	oh another stupid question if it's not too annoying: I have some lines that work fine if it's in the main script, but if I move it into its own file and then just reference that script by filename (it's set as executable), it does not appear to work

2016-04-12 19:33:27	arubislander	Installed it on my Palm III (something or other). Never really took off on that platform.
2016-04-12 19:33:52	arubislander	Even Oracle did offer a database running on in, if I remember correctly.
2016-04-12 19:34:25	zmoylan-pi	i miss palmos...
2016-04-12 19:34:38	zmoylan-pi	i got a lot done on that platform
2016-04-12 19:35:20	Stilvoid	Arthur_D: :D
2016-04-12 19:35:34	popey	Yeah, I loved PalmOS
2016-04-12 19:35:43	popey	Never seen a decent emulator for it which is surprising
2016-04-12 19:35:49	popey	Everything else seems to get emulated, but not that
2016-04-12 19:36:20	Stilvoid	sounds like you have a project lined up then ;)
2016-04-12 19:36:25	arubislander	My last device was a Tungsten|T. Still have it lying in a drawer... Too bad the digitizer has gone bonkers...
2016-04-12 19:36:36	Stilvoid	(wouldn't have a *clue* where to start writing an emulator for something)
2016-04-12 19:36:37	popey	I have a Palm Tx
2016-04-12 19:36:41	popey	me either
2016-04-12 19:36:50	 *	Stilvoid hands popey an 'n'
2016-04-12 19:36:51	popey	well, I do. "Ask someone else"
2016-04-12 19:36:56	Stilvoid	hah yes :)
2016-04-12 19:36:59	zmoylan-pi	i have a palm e sitting in a drawer somewhere, battery won't charge...
2016-04-12 19:37:03	 *	popey hands Stilvoid a pedantry award
2016-04-12 19:37:16	Stilvoid	I'll put it on the shelf with the other thousand or so
2016-04-12 19:38:28	popey	\o/ Got MAME working on Ubuntu phone
2016-04-12 19:38:31	popey	productivity--
2016-04-12 19:38:43	Stilvoid	Nice
2016-04-12 19:38:55	Stilvoid	Might try it on my N7 again sometime soon
2016-04-12 19:39:14	Stilvoid	last time I tried Ubuntu was about 2 and a half years ago
2016-04-12 19:40:22	arubislander	Whenever I see N7 I always think Nokia instead of Nexus... Why would that be?
2016-04-12 19:42:15	zmoylan-pi	rememberance of a past love...
2016-04-12 19:42:25	popey	First love was always the strongest...
2016-04-12 19:42:43	 *	popey fondly remembers his Nokias
2016-04-12 19:42:46	arubislander	Think is I have never had a Nokia...
2016-04-12 19:42:47	zmoylan-pi	i miss my psions...
2016-04-12 19:43:00	zmoylan-pi	i still have my nokias... :-)
2016-04-12 19:43:59	zmoylan-pi	that on the psion 3a i could organise a repeated event last saturday of every second month and no device since can...
2016-04-12 19:45:10	zmoylan-pi	and that was in mid flippin 90s...
2016-04-12 19:45:10		[19:45]
2016-04-12 19:47:39	arubislander	everything was better in the mid 90's... :-D
2016-04-12 19:48:03	popey	except hair styles
2016-04-12 19:48:09	popey	and ties
2016-04-12 19:49:33	arubislander	O yeah, those were terrible...
2016-04-12 19:50:10	arubislander	but then again, there was more hair, and less waistline... lol
2016-04-12 19:50:22	zmoylan-pi	every decade has it's oh god what were we thinking
2016-04-12 19:51:02	arubislander	I predict this one will be the sun shades...
2016-04-12 19:51:13	zmoylan-pi	nah, obsession with iot
2016-04-12 19:52:07	arubislander	speaking of which... anyone else not really excited about every appliance in the home potentially having it's own internet facing ipv6 address?
2016-04-12 19:52:07	zmoylan-pi	every lightbulb with it's own web server...
2016-04-12 19:53:02	zmoylan-pi	the idea of automation is good, people have been doing that since leccy was invented... but it's never worked /right/
2016-04-12 19:53:23	arubislander	I was more thinking of the increased attach surface...
2016-04-12 19:54:00	arubislander	* attack surface
2016-04-12 19:54:04	zmoylan-pi	cause it'll be really funny when some hacker turns off the central heating of an entire countries homes when snow falls :-P
2016-04-12 19:54:53	arubislander	well, no... but if everything would be connected to everything, then a vulnerability in one could compromise your whole home network, couldn't it?
2016-04-12 19:56:36	zmoylan-pi	50 million light bulbs all with the credentials admin admin... :-)
2016-04-12 19:58:15	arubislander	O man, don't get me started on that!
2016-04-12 19:58:41	arubislander	I actually experienced a whole neighborhood where every modem had the same password...
2016-04-12 19:59:48	zmoylan-pi	in ireland at least they had some imagination for wifi ap... :-) http://www.bacik.ie/eircomwep/howto.html
